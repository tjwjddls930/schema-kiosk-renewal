                explanation: "Through his <Cloud Tree> and <Ideal Garden> series, artist Go-Woon Lee has projected his emotions into real spaces such as parks, forests, and the sea, depicting the psychological landscape of the utopia of healing through media such as drawings, paintings, and animations. It has been expressed through. The coloring method, which creates a unique texture through the repeated process of painting and grinding paint on the canvas, and the delicate, warm tones of the screen drawn after adding subtle sparkle to the paper, create a dreamy atmosphere in the work. In addition, the animation, produced by compiling and editing hundreds of hand-drawn drawings and adding sound with low humming, attempts to connect emotionally with the audience. Artist Go-Woon Lee's work feels extremely unrealistic yet familiar at the same time, and the images in the work seem like something we've seen in a dream at least once, evoking the viewer's dreams, imagination, and memories. This “Lullaby in the Garden” exhibition unravels the time and space of the night garden, which the artist has been focusing on, through the metaphor of a lullaby. Like the melody of a soft lullaby that guides a child from the world of consciousness to the world of dreams, this exhibition allows you to set aside the logic and tension of everyday life and experience gentle relaxation through the work.",

                        text: "Goun Lee’s work begins from each day of his life. Although it is not a complete record of daily life, where you stay and what you see and feel is important. The author tries to maintain a slight distance from contemporary acute discourse and macro issues and to capture a state that is free from thoughts arising from external factors. At first, I focused on myself as a being in the world. A field of snow far away and a woman. The sea in the distance and the people on it. The dreamlike atmosphere that seems to meet reality and fantasy, created against the backdrop of nature, is a characteristic that has persisted from the beginning of Lee Go-un's work until recently. Not only the moon rainbow, but also memories of weather such as rain, snow, and clouds, the atmosphere of seasons such as spring and winter, and unfamiliar landscapes that seem to have escaped reality even though they are reality, become the starting point of the artist's imagination that connects the inner world with the external world. With the snow and rain in the background, people with faces that become one with the ‘cloud tree’ seem to stay in an imaginary space that allows free thinking like clouds. A being whose face, which most clearly reveals its identity, has disappeared allows it to escape the limited individuality defined by social norms and common notions. In fact, situations where snow accumulates and rain occur frequently in everyday life. But these are mysterious changes. Above all, snow and rain help us escape from reality. It interferes with clear vision. It blurs the boundaries, leaves room, and affects emotions. The world demands clear divisions. However, there are times when you want to erase all sections. Rain and snow make us take our feet off reality and have time to daydream. This is how the unknown space and time is imagined. After getting married and becoming a mother, Lee Go-un began drawing as if she were singing lullabies to her children. It wasn't something I specifically intended or planned. It was not intended to address the labor or practical hardships of women who became mothers. The more he focused on himself, the more images related to children appeared in his mind. It was as natural as water flowing and seasons changing. The toys in the work serve as excellent materials for weaving imagination. The reason why works containing memories of children are set at night is also connected to imagination. As is the case with snow and rain, sharp boundaries become blurred at night. The mysterious energy of the night provides languid comfort and tranquility free from the hustle and bustle of the day. Above all, for a child, night is a time to sleep and dream. The author imagines what kind of dreamland the child will enter. The author depicts dream time. A child's dream and the author's imagination intersect. The author falls into a daydream like that. Daydreaming is an activity of the thinking self (cogito). Dreamers are the state of the soul located below existence, above nothingness, and the masters of consciousness that explore the intermediate zone between reality and unreality and induce poetic daydreaming. Daydreaming is not a dream, which is an activity of the unconscious. Dreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness persists. Consciousness sustains and guides the dream. Meanwhile, the gardens and landscapes that often appear in Lee Go-un's works also exist in everyday life, but are based on memories related to fantastic situations that seem to escape daily life and experiences at travel destinations. The space Lee Go-un creates is like a romantic heterotopia. Heterotopia, which is different from real space and is not a utopia, is a unique space disconnected from daily life, but it is a space composed of incompatible heterogeneous elements that exist in reality. This time, the author floats across the border between reality and imagination, reality and fantasy. Moments where reality and unreality overlap are repeated, creating more room for the artist's imagination. In this way, the work method, attitude, and completed works that Lee Go-un has consistently pursued since the beginning are all closely related to imagination. Imagination begins with the perception of an image. The artist's imagination transforms the images received through perception. The external space and the internal space encourage each other and grow. A poetic space is created that allows for more possibilities than objective facts, and the inner space expands. Because imagination brings to mind images that are not visible in existing images, the artist discovers and expresses something hidden deep within the image. However, daydreaming, which is the main activity of imagination, is different from contemplation, which focuses on a specific problem and seeks a logical solution. It is a mental activity that occurs naturally through the activity of imagination without any clear will. However, because daydreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness exists rather than an unconscious state such as dreaming, the author is able to place himself at the center as a thinking subject. A dream is an activity in a state that is neither completely unconscious nor completely conscious, an unreal function that does not belong to rationalistic reality, but has roots in the real world. In this somewhat dazed and comfortable state of daydreaming, the artist loosely and naturally conjures up images and daydreams. And then it unfolds in the work. Imagination, which can accept images and transform them independently, is universal, so we who look at Lee Go-un's works can also have diverse imaginations. Infinity, which can be said to be the philosophical category of daydreaming, is within us. It is connected to the expansion of existence that continues in solitude, even though real life suppresses and caution stops. The author (we) dreams of infinity in an infinite world. Let’s delve a little deeper into the warm space-time and infinite world presented by this work, which “begins and ends smoothly, free from intellectual labor.”",

                explanation: "2023 Schema Art Museum Gyemyo Year, the first exhibition of the new year ‘Ecole de Cheongju’ – Schema’s masterpiece exhibition is an exhibition of works from the collection that has another meaning. 2024 marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Schema Museum of Art. This collection exhibition is an exhibition that presents important works while thinking about the past 14 years. Works by the late artist who was a close friend of Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art. This is an exhibition planned while thinking and reminiscing about the precious works of close junior artists and artists who have participated in solo exhibitions at the Schema Art Museum. These are the collections of Ecole de Chemat, which presents paintings, photographs, and video works by a total of 13 artists. Artist Kim Jae-gwan's recent ‘Relationship’ series, among half a century of geometric abstract art works, depicts nature, breaking away from the work format that has long been approached through rational interpretation of geometric abstract structures. Rather than painting nature as a common-sense landscape, it is expressed as ‘natural phenomena’ – ‘light,’ ‘sound,’ ‘color,’ and ‘rhyme.’ Kim Young-bae (1947-2001) was a late artist who considered a unique methodology that served as a bridge between modernism and postmodernism. He experimented with new dimensions of painting by colliding pop and realism simultaneously, clashing lines and surfaces, concepts and layers, etc. He was a writer. He had an open attitude to various fields and was very interested in comics, so he served as a professor in the Department of Comics at Sangmyung University and trained many younger students. The “Untitled” series creates screens with repeated patterns through a combination of language such as figurative images and geometric patterns. Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he focuses on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. Artist Kim Jae-nam's <Lost Landscape> painting series collects sea images of specific locations containing cultural and social memories and presents them in an incomplete state through “defamiliarization.” In order to evoke memories as an interpretant, black charcoal is painted and rubbed repeatedly on the canvas countless times, replacing it with a simple black and white color plane involving the body. For artist Kim Seong-mi, the forest is an entity, and in recent years, the author has continued to use the forest as a motif to capture all aspects of change over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We search for ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work. Artist Park Jin-myeong is a representative modern orientalist artist in Cheongju. He expresses images that come to mind in his paintings. Certain scenes that pass by him in passing produce other memories and images, and by repeating the overlapping of those moments, they become a new scene and an afterimage. engraved with The image of the darkness with the moon floating on it and the moment below it overlapping and playing over and over again permeates the screen as a single scene. Artist Shim Jae-bun goes beyond the object ‘lotus flower’ and penetrates the essence of the object and recreates it in his own language. In order to reproduce the invisible existence of nature and humans, ‘ultra-telephoto lens’ and ‘ultra-wide-angle lens’ are used to capture nature that cannot be seen with the naked eye in a single image, creating a work of art that feels like a surreal fact. Artist Lee Hong-won strongly reveals Korean aesthetics through dazzling colors. The tigers and human figures that appear in the painting are based on tradition, but also imply accessibility to modern art. Freedom of subject matter or expression, simplification or exaggeration, boldness, and humorous aesthetics and humor are the main characteristics of Hongwon Lee's work, and the classics and modern times, the world of myth and the world of reality coexist in synchronicity. Artist Eunsoo Lim is an artist who embodies women's sensuality and senses with a sense of feminism. Due to her unique self-consciousness, she moves further away from the cogs of modernism and expresses her own critical awareness and new drawings through movement. From 2020 until recently, the artist has presented the current social, climate, and environmental phenomena through the performance ‘I am here now’ with a unique sense of comfort and circulation. In ‘I Am Here Now 7’, the author enters and joins the water circulation process of Daecheong Lake. And by expanding the self, it becomes an agent and mother of life, presenting through symbolic tools and actions what we truly value and protect in this era. Artist Jeon Yeon-il (1945-2021) captures the restoration of humanity lost due to the development of industry in modern society, and at the same time uses the five cardinal colors that our people have long revered and used very closely in their daily lives as the subject matter of his work. The five colors present modernized visualization works based on the joys, sorrows, etc. of our lives. The visualized work appears shamanistic yet primitive. Kisan artist Jeong Myeong-hee has unfolded the story of Geumgang and the universe with a variety of materials and colors, focusing on Hanji and ink. In recent years, he has been talking about the fundamentals of life using black ink on a white background, comparing it to the spirit of literary painting. The birds of Kisan fill the screen, appearing in black ink or as blank space. Lee divides the canvas with a fundamental form resembling a cross, visualizing life as freely flying. Artist Cho Hyun-ae captures ‘time’ on canvas. The artist's work, where lost time and present time coexist, contains the accumulation of time in the space the artist creates. In particular, in the artist's virtual space, images of the past and present coexist, and landscape paintings, genre paintings, and Western masterpieces from the Joseon Dynasty come together to form multiple layers of space and overlap. The coexistence of past and present within a two-dimensional plane forms the artist’s own ‘surreal’ world and creates a visual metaphor. Artist Choi Min-geon expresses our enjoyment of wandering between virtuality and reality, subject and object, due to the ambiguity of boundaries. The dog that creates an optical illusion on the screen blurs the boundary between virtuality and reality, and expresses the appearance of dogs, the most familiar of humans and other animals, making us feel different from us and at the same time feel homogeneous.",

                explanation: "The Soft Life exhibition invites artists who instill a warm or new perspective on those around them without being shaken while living in a dynamic modern society. The four artists who look at the various peripheries of everyday life and create new images using everyday events and images make us think that they are not only creators, but also existential in themselves. Their methodology, which is revealed while composing events and images, consists of figurative painting and seeks to enter each person's world. Artist Park Hae-bin travels between Jeju Island and Cheongju, accumulating imprinted images and various events in her paintings. His works, which expose the illusion of the flat surface or reproduce dense compositions with small strokes, attempt to go beyond the limits of representation and enter a new world of representation, experimenting with its methodology. His work, which collects images from around him and devotes himself to various methods of painting, evokes unfamiliarity and curiosity in the audience. Artist Minjeong Seo deals with events and images by intersecting the dog's gaze with her own. It can be inferred that it took a long time for the various delicate emotional events and chunks of images left in the mind to be finalized and composed as his material. He composes landscapes containing the wild nature and origins of plants, constructs the landscape of the mind, and reveals images as if stacking them up using the unique methodology of oriental painting, layer by layer. Artist Gyu-seon Lee finds and expresses images that resonate with his psychological environment between his repetitive daily life and the landscapes that come and go. The whirlpool of the Mindless Stream, the scenery of Cheongju, and the characters help us infer his harsh, dry, yet living world. His realism shows himself unfiltered, with quick strokes and expressions. Artist Cho Min-ah unfolds on screen the contradictions, absurdities, and jokes that occur in everyday life. He envisions several fragmentary events, expresses them, and expands them. On these screens, the audience can watch him perform his unique work and see the artist's imaginary trajectory. We want to show the world of today's painters through the lives of the four artists above, as they gently unfold them.",

                        text: "Over a long history, the landscape we live in has undergone many changes. Even at this moment, the landscape is changing. For painters of the past, landscapes have constantly been the subject matter of their works. As a painter living in modern times, I always worry about what kind of landscape to draw and how to paint it. During the two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent time looking more intently at the world around me. It was an opportunity to go into nature where no one was around, meditate, and have a more diverse visual experience. The landscape I see and draw is on the border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction, familiarity and unfamiliarity. Based on my unique visual experience, I reconstructed the landscape of reality where the heterogeneous emotions of familiarity and unfamiliarity coexist, and created cross-sections of the landscape at the psychological border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction through two-dimensional painting work. I want to show you. This clearly originates from visual perception of the real world, but it is not simply a reflection of real space, but creates another space through mental processes. Through a landscape that seems to contain a hidden story that cannot be fully known just by looking at it, we can look at things that we could not or have not seen in reality due to familiarity, and psychologically understand the heterogeneous emotions such as familiarity and unfamiliarity that exist in each individual's subconscious. We aim to arouse curiosity about boundaries.",

That may not be the case, but if you only pursue something different every time, that would also be close to a lie. That's what life is like. It's ordinary. However, even in that moment, even in an ordinary day, there are definitely times when you discover something shining. Numerous stories, conversations, passage of time, repetitive daily life and faces of groups. An image, that is, a certain image. Big and small everyday experiences and pieces of life that are scattered, broken, and emerging. image. Because of that image, I feel pain that I don't need to feel and struggle to hold on to it. The tough stories of life and the people in those stories that sometimes make you feel shut out and sometimes feel grateful. Something that cannot be resolved from embodied moments is because of images. I struggle because I want to recall that image, capture it, and express it. Relationships with many people and something invisible. A Self-Portrait in which the qualities of the relationship and encounter intersect and the physical properties are mixed, but this is not as intended. Confronted self-portrait. Life situations that cannot be avoided or ignored. Moments that must always be encountered in an organic form. Maybe I didn't want to draw myself. I wanted to express it in some other form, but I may also have faced limitations in my own objectivity. The subtle and generative expressions of a knife's touch or an oil painting, and the intersection of physical properties form a certain shape - it is an image, but it does not constitute an image - to achieve something else. Because the action and method were not intended or recognized movements, the direction of the brush moving between strokes manifests itself as meaningless brush strokes with an abstract nature. It sounds obvious, it's obvious, but it's an ordinary and natural thing to live. Life and daily life that are like an unavoidable experience in life and an organic living life. A vibrant life where cells come together, scatter, and move. Organic relationships that are inevitable and sometimes petty. The struggle to find and obsess over pictoriality within that ‘organic relationship.’ It is an image that is close but also far away. A self-portrait drawn like that. So anyway, I will draw again. I will probably draw again in this inseparable relationship, as if I were living a life that I could not avoid or ignore. The self-portrait I draw like that may not be a self-portrait.",

                        text: "Personal attitudes that constantly change depending on the situation, fluid value judgments, and the way we currently live in balance as if weighing scales always create dynamic energies. I thought that the cracks and harmony that occurred within it were natural things that came from different people living together. Reminiscent of a dream-like situation where some people live in the future and some people live in the past and the present intersects, I started thinking about those who are waiting in a messy space for something in the future that will not come, or for something that can change the present. Just like Tetris blocks of different shapes are put together and destroyed, we wanted to tell the story of our daily lives and reality in the relationship between individuals who own the present and the relationships surrounding them, despite the complexity of coexisting with others. Symbols or objects with symbolic meaning appear, but there is a universal symbol that everyone recognizes, and when I think about it and make it meaningful, I draw those elements in the picture. Working while creating allegory is attractive because it has a double meaning, but it is not the main element of my work. There are cases where colors or lines are introduced as figurative images to harmonize the screen composition. Because the work comes out of that process, there is a narrative, but there seem to be parts that are not understood. Although causal relationships and connection points between objects and people are important, the basic foundation for their combination begins with a sense of formative balance. Although it is not understandable at a glance, I hope that it will be seen as a personal narrative or as a work that reminds us of our current lives, using the situation, color, and atmosphere shown in the painting as a clue.",

                        text: "Recent work is an attempt to attach the idea that ‘the world is constantly broken and rebuilt again’ into the images and working process of each painting. I question whether the large and small violence we experience, alienation from lack of communication, emptiness, or complex and confusing scenes and fears that are difficult to interpret may be a very obvious order or an axis toward balance, albeit disturbing. Through my work, I am struggling between ambivalent things, being alienated, hurt, and unable to do either this or that, such as communication and non-communication, ideal and reality, open and closed, the desire to speak and the desire to be silent, the positivity and positivity applied to the same event. Pay attention to things like negative attitudes and the emotions at the time. The ink and ink drawings move toward breaking the object, and the color pigments (powder paint) jostle against each other in a movement to find the object, but the boundaries naturally collapse during the work process. Through the process of repeatedly breaking and putting back together, we ask ourselves how we can make meaning of the fragmented and confusing structure of the world and unclear experiences and memories. I have expressed countless moments of alienated emotions and feelings, such as individual and universal hardships in life, various pains and wounds, repeated failures, and idling, by borrowing the lush structure of untouched nature. There are conflicting impulses in everything, and we are constantly concerned about contradictions, trying to engage with them, organize them, understand them, and think about what might be better. That fight can be expressed in many different languages, but to me, it feels most clearly as the force trying to fragment and the force trying to build. Part of my world is broken and experienced loss due to certain events, and only after going through the process of reassembling or accepting it, that is, the process of building, can I move on to the next journey. Perhaps the process of fragmentation and construction itself is movement. What is clear is that breaking and fragmenting do not represent negativity, or conversely, building does not represent positivity. These are like different signals that cause things to move in slightly different directions and change shape.",

                explanation: "Bang Hyo-seong's work uses borderless language, crossing the boundaries of place and time, consciousness and unconsciousness, solemnity and kitsch, and philosophy and episode. All beings who think according to the order of creation are born with meaning, and within a given period of time, that meaning may be discovered or disappear for a moment. In a world where the visible and the invisible coexist, I work to reveal the visible and the invisible. All living things and the material world have a given time. Nothing is permanent, just long and short, and it repeats creation and extinction. The author talks about thoughts about all things located in space and time in the language of transcending boundaries. Everything changes. By time. The phenomena that have emerged in the present time speak across the material world and the spiritual world. The time of now includes eternity and may disappear after a while. I spend a long time thinking about what the essence of the object I am pursuing is. Essence is something that comes before recognition, and there is a bias between essence and non-essence. Essence cannot take precedence over existence. Existence exists as existence and non-existence, but its essence is nothing more than a momentary perception that cannot be defined in time. What do we see, feel, and perceive, whether it is an object or a mental thing? Perception has imperfections, illusions, prejudices, absurdities, and ambiguities. Regarding the fact that the world of material, which is only a part of the world of spirit, is easily visible to the eye, I question whether the world of spirit is obsessed with prejudice that obscures its essence due to the fixation of ideas. My work gives meaning to the inherent properties of materials. The essence of my objects or philosophy may also be another essence interpreted by me. There is an instinctive desire to pursue eternity in time that repeats creation and extinction. Everything disappears with time. As an invested being, everything, including me, forms a dynamic structure in the relationship between the visible and the invisible in the material and spiritual world. It is a work that materializes spiritual things through formative language. Think about what art placed in eternal time is trying to show. Materials that exist in the moment have value as works of art created wearing the clothes of imagination. This existence also exists only for a moment as it heads toward extinction. Various symbols are borrowed and used in my work. There are many formative elements that symbolically express things that arise in latent consciousness through image collection. Humans create and use symbol systems to communicate with each other. Ambiguous symbols of inability to communicate are sometimes used. These are things written as formative images. This exhibition is based on the phenomenology of mental communication in symbol systems. It is the work of replacing material with mental and mental with material. Materials imaged in a minimalistic work style through drawings and some installations. I want to show the spiritual value and structure of the material. For Sartre, existence precedes essence. This means that essence changes with time, and recognition of essence gives meaning to existence. However, perception is incomplete and is a process that takes place in time. Cognition is a part of the essence and is placed within the scope of the world through reason. Existence is the fact that it exists, and it exists in meaninglessness, such as a certain role, personality, direction, etc. Having meaning in existence is the essence of its existence, and that essence becomes explanatory. All beings change over time and their essence also changes. Essence is named by its use and given meaning by the language in which it is named. A being whose purpose is unknown or unfamiliar can be explained as existing outside the world, or in other words, an inexperienced being. However, since existence and non-existence have a counterpart, it can be a relationship between the immediate and the for-itself. Rationality is a subset of absurdity. In other words, complete cognition or rationality does not exist. Because the essence changes, a perfect combination is impossible. In the human world, language and emotions are communicated through an incomplete recognition system due to imperfect communication, and communication is also a broken part of recognition. we all know I understand. It gives legitimacy to the fiction and completes communication. However, there is no language that perfectly expresses our thoughts. ‘Be silent about things you cannot speak of,’ says Wittgenstein.",

                explanation: "This year, the Schema Museum of Art celebrates its 14th anniversary. For the past 14 years, the Schema Museum of Art, as a representative contemporary art museum in the region, has been pursuing art that breathes with the new era and the future and exhibitions that converge with other fields. In addition, it reflected the trends of the times and social phenomena, established the identity of the museum through various thematic exhibitions and international exchange exhibitions for the development of contemporary art in the Cheongju region, and established itself as a representative private art museum in Korea beyond the region. Since opening in 2009, the Schema Museum of Art has strived to serve as a regional international exchange center by hosting various contemporary art exhibitions. The 10-year narrative of the Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition began with the 1st Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition ‘New ASIA·Sympathy & Difference’ held on November 14, 2014. In particular, the international exchange exhibition began with Governor Lee Si-jong's love of art and his wish to create a representative international contemporary art exhibition in Cheongju. Without this interest and support from Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City, the current 10 years of international exchanges would not have occurred. As we welcome the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, I would like to express my deep gratitude once again, as it began with the decision of former Governor Lee Si-jong. In addition, we would like to once again thank Chungcheongbuk-do Governor Kim Young-hwan and Cheongju City Mayor Lee Beom-seok for their help in hosting the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition. ‘10 years’ is called ‘Decade’ in English. There is a deep metaphor latent in these words. In other words, the word 10 years is used in the West to mean, “A new paradigm begins in 10 years,” just as in Korea there is a saying, “Even rivers and mountains change in 10 years.” 2014 1st – New ASIA · Sympathy & Difference 2015 2nd – After the 90’s Tanamura·Jinmok era, Korean and Japanese contemporary art and about the present 2016 3rd – New dream New future 2017 4th – After Hyecho – Korea · Communication of Indian Cultures 2018 5th – Korean-French Contemporary Art ‘New Dialogue’ 2019 6th – French International Exchange Exhibition ‘2019 New Dialogue’ 2020 7th – Korea-France Korean Artists 2021 8th – Korea-Japan International Exchange Exhibition - Climate of Dialogue Again 2022 9th – New Coordinates of Korean-China Contemporary Art 2023 10th – Retrospective of Cheongju International Contemporary Art Decade and Prospects for a New Future Meanwhile, Asian Exchange Exhibition, Korea-China-Japan Exhibition, Korea-China Exhibition, We have held quite a few international exchange exhibitions, including the Korea-Japan Exhibition, Korea-India Exhibition, Korea-Netherlands Exchange Exhibition, Korea-Bosnia Exchange Exhibition, and Korea-France Exchange Exhibition. However, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the format of the exhibition changed and the mechanism of the exhibition changed to a new pattern using online video media. After such a difficult time, I feel truly fortunate and happy that all the participating artists were able to gather together for the 23rd year of the international exchange exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art in Cheongju. The 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition features 10 Korean artists (Jae-gwan Kim, Jeong-hee Kim, Jae-nam Kim, Yoon-hee Seo, Jae-bun Shim, Sang-wook Moon, Eun-soo Lim, Ik-gyu Choi, Hyo-seong Bang, and Eun-young Heo) as well as participants from China, Japan, Thailand, India, the Netherlands, and Bosnia. 11 people (Cang Xin, Chen Gang, Uno Kazuyuki, Hasegawa Ichirou, Kongsak Gulglangdon, Thawatchai Changkwien, 21 authors, including Ajitvar Kumar Douglas, Ravi Ranjan, Pietertje van Splunter, Jessy Rahman, and Jusuf Hadẑifejzović It is an international contemporary art festival in which artists participate. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Schema Museum of Art hosting an international contemporary art exhibition. Among the foreign artists participating in this international exhibition, Cang Xin (China) and Jusuf Hadžifejzović (Bosnia) are already internationally renowned. The 10 Korean artists also comprised of those who have been evaluated as the most creative artists in international exhibitions. Therefore, I have no doubt that this exhibition will be a ‘Decade’ that looks back on the past 10 years and at the same time promises a new 10 years. We would like to once again express our deepest gratitude to Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City for their cooperation for this exhibition.",

                explanation: "2023. Late Aspect Exhibition - Beautifully Thinking Art In 2023, the Late Aspect Contemporary Art Association plans to hold an exhibition under the theme of ‘Beautifully Thinking Art.’ Currently, before we have even escaped the coronavirus crisis, we are facing a society that is rapidly changing again due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. All people on Earth feel threatened by an unstable future. Nevertheless, we must face these overall problems and phenomena, overcome them, accept them, and find a way out by combining them with our respective realities. This may be because life changes, continues, and deepens under any circumstances. What is the vitality that instills the will to live in an unsettling reality? It can be said that fundamental introspection is necessary in each person's own position. As the biggest core of accepting the variations and mutations of the art ecosystem, we plan to organize an exhibition with the meaning of ‘meeting a new era with beautifully thought-out art.’",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed according to the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. The 'Smooth Stone Field' exhibition explores how the material world and the world of metaphysics are related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence this has on modern art. Modern art artists are the generation with the smoothest surface in human history. This exhibition examines how things still exist as part of the material world and how they interact and work. The 'Smooth Stone Field 1' exhibition features four artists, Kim Man-sun, Kim Yun-seop, Lee Byeong-ho, and Cho Min-seon, who basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and use the body represented by material to show what significance this method has for us and what methods it will take in the future. It was a time to open our eyes to the times and it was an exhibition to think about. Smooth Stone Field 2, which continues for 23 years, is an exhibition that reconsiders the modern flatness with a monitor, represented by rare earth elements, as the surface. This is to examine whether the consideration of the two-dimensionality created by humans since ancient times can be interpreted into the realm of art and to deal with artists who use it to present their work using new methodologies. Artist Minjeong Geum focuses on creating new surface compositions by mixing the surface of the monitor with materials such as wood and stone. All of her sculptures present a new form of sculptural sculpture by actively revealing material properties taken from nature. As a first-generation Korean media artist, artist Kim Jun has used the topic of tattoos to assess the issue of expression where an individual's identity is revealed to the surface. As a media work created with a 3D program, it can be said to represent data properties before NFT. Author Yunseong Lee is one of the most active NFT artists of his time and is creating a new myth of flatness by substituting otaku culture into mythology. He is at the cutting edge of NFT work with his continued interest in online virtual worlds. It uses stories produced from Greek and Roman myths and legends as a motif, and uses expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga and moe as its format. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. Seungcheol Ok is an artist who creates large-scale paintings and sculptures that reveal the expressions and faces of characters, and experiments with what kind of visual situations they create in online and virtual environments. The artist, who is also famous for collaborating with various genres, transforms new experiments with the flat surface into various forms of collaborative works. In modern times, flatness is not a very rare space. However, the newly expanded concept of flatness is progressing beyond online and through conversion into data, with different physical properties. We pay attention to how contemporary art works interact with and communicate with audiences using new and changing materials, and reconsider the flatness of modern times through the works of four participating artists: Minjeong Geum, Jun Kim, Yunseong Lee, and Seungcheol Ok. I want to see it.",

                        text: "The 2023 series of works used a material called concrete, a symbol of modern urban industrialization. My concrete frame is also a small symbol of urban architecture. By taking an image of a specific wall, the natural phenomena (wind movement, light and shadow movement) and light and shadow movements collected at that location are converted into data and reacted to the movement of the video image. Then, the video result is mixed with the concrete sculpture frame. In addition, in 2021, a video created by filming the natural phenomenon of a specific place called 'Soswaewon' in Damyang and reacting to the image of the building of that place will be presented along with sculpture and formative elements inspired by the actual building. It was produced by mixing and matching videos. Natural phenomena are areas that humans cannot control. However, in this day and age, we have reached an era where computers can reproduce human emotions and natural phenomena. I had an interesting thought, “Wouldn’t it be possible in the future to predict, prevent, and change natural phenomena called natural disasters?” Natural phenomena that are closely related to human emotions sometimes provide realistic data for human survival. Technology affects both art and science.",

This belief clashes with the limitations of various contemporary production technologies every time his icons are converted/circulated into multiple media. In other words, when his paintings become sculptures or mirrors, when his paintings become images, and when his paintings are transferred to other canvases, the shapes hover between ideal and reality, subtly changing or weathering.”_Jeong Hyeon <Moo. -Excerpt from the Patina of the Time-Space-Continuum> Artist Ok Seung-cheol has been dealing with the issue of originality from the perspective of the post-digital era from the beginning of his career to the present. By using digital images as originals to print and share not only traditional media such as paintings and sculptures, but also the boundaries between reality and virtuality, and art and non-art, the irony of the intersection of light (digital original) images and heavy (art work) images is highlighted. The process in which an image is not fixed in one form, but interacts with it inside and out, materializing it into various forms and textures, and the coexistence of so-called lightness and seriousness created by the printed outer shell (a work of art that emphasizes infinitely replicable digital images and uniqueness) We present work that examines the meaning of originality from a new perspective by emphasizing the contradictions. In this exhibition, the artist thought of and organized the small exhibition hall itself as a format of a work rather than each work individually. From the flat painting <Portrait, 2023> to the video of <Never Again, 2018> projected on a projector, and the pair of mirrors that reflect it <Outline, 2022>, the flat-shaped multi-media work is composed to create a visual effect of various thin thicknesses. Presented to the audience. As the artist intended, it encourages people to experience appreciation and interpretation of points that cannot be satisfied with the physical form due to the limitations of flatness. In particular, <Face, 2023>, a double-sided relief in the form of a compressed flat sculpture without a frontal face, is a work in which only the same back view is shown repeatedly, without showing the face that the title suggests. By intentionally creating a feeling of frustration, the work questions the limitations of the flat image on the monitor screen and its essence. Additionally, the border, which is compressed with many layers stacked on top of each other, has its limitations.",

                        text: "I am interested in expressions revealed in old narratives and contemporary visual culture. Stories produced from myths and legends such as Greek and Roman mythology are used as motifs, and expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga or moe are used as the form. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. [Torso] was inspired by a damaged ancient Greek sculpture and the final scene of the theatrical version of the Japanese animation <Ghost in the Shell (1995)>. New images discovered among the destroyed bodies were transformed into a series of works, colliding with various elements such as gushing or flying blood drops, sparkling or exploding effects, and swirling space. [The Three Graces], a large painting based on the motif of the Three Graces from Greek mythology, has been a subject that has long inspired the artist. The work was done by referring to the most typical pose of the Three Graces and the characteristics of pretty girl cartoon characters. This work, which consists of ten pieces of canvas that come together to form one large screen, was created while thinking about what the images seen through palm-sized comic books or TV media would look like when they became the main characters of a large painting. The [Medusa] series, created as a series of paintings and digital sculpture videos, began with a single drawing. The drawings are the results of a process in which the drawings are produced as classic animation-style paintings, and then the virtual digital three-dimensional works created based on these are finally printed on a 3D printer and become physical sculptures. If paintings in the past were various attempts to reproduce reality on a flat surface, I thought that currently we are in the process of experimenting with how to reconstruct the already flat world or expand it into a new space.",

This is a program that tries to express ‘landscape emotions’. The ‘Hidden Space’ program is a program themed around the keywords of ‘geometric abstraction’ in contemporary art using art museum collections along with cultural arts education history. The 'Schema Museum Atelier' program is a self-discovery program where you discover your own uniqueness and specialness through artistic creation through new visual expressions through a time of observing, appreciating, and empathizing with the world through three contemporary artists.

As I was walking along Naesudong-ro 102beon-gil, which I pass every day, without looking at the floor, I slowly began to notice things that I had considered indifferent. I looked closely at the low stone walls of various shapes and the weeds growing between the gaps in the sidewalk blocks. Walking slowly became my daily routine, wondering how I could grow through all that. Things that had been invisible until now began to appear. Falling leaves, cats leisurely passing by, the sound of footsteps of people passing by... It was a new feeling for me, who always walked looking straight ahead. And the weeds that had bloomed with persistent vitality suddenly began to look sad and beautiful. And I started drawing one by one the weeds I saw while walking along the path.",

In order to maintain a sustainable balance in local art and build an art ecosystem, the Shema Art Museum holds a special event for young artists every year. Proceed. The 2023 Unstable Possibilities Exhibition is an exhibition that supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists and hopes to create an artistic ecosystem in our region by providing an opportunity for new challenges for local young artists. As Unstable Possibility implies, young writers are unstable, but contain infinite possibilities. We get a glimpse of new possibilities through the exhibition of young artists who visualize their unstable reason and their own perception of the world in various ways and express their thoughts about the world and art in their works, from the stories of individuals living in their daily lives. I want to see it. I would like to focus on the perspectives of young artists who have just graduated and are consolidating their emotional inner self through paintings by combining the cross-section and artist's perspective with the environment surrounding them and the artist's consciousness to create new creations. Part 1, who builds his own world by revealing aspects of life using fragmentary materials, Se-eun Kim, Soo-wan Kim, Yu-bin Kim, Ji-yeon Seo, Hae-in Shin, Eun-jeong Oh, Seon-jae Yoon, Do-hoon Lee, Ha-neul Lee, Hyeong-jun Jin Part 2 So-young Kwon, Do-hoon Kim, Ji-hoon Kim, Gyu-bong Shim, Seung-ji Lee , Kiyu, Jeong Young-hoon, Jeong Ji-yong, Han Ye-jin, and Hong Myeong-gi.

In each painting, I try to remain faithful to the spontaneous emotions at the time. To me, the amplitude of meaning given by the expressed object is not that great.

In modern art, emotion refers to the artist's strong desire and creativity, and reason refers to the intellectual ability and technical skills that can realize emotion. Reason and emotion have maintained an absolute mutual relationship in modern art, and works are always progressing by repeating the dominance between reason and emotion. Participating artists include 16 artists: Seo-yeon Kim, Young-bae Kim, Jae-kwan Kim, Sang-wook Moon, Young-dae Park, Jin-myeong Park, Myeong-hee Shim, Jae-bun Shim, Seok-gyu Yoo, Seong-su Lim, Eun-su Lim, Yeon-il Jeon, Myung-hee Jeong, Hyun-ae Jo, Young-seop Han, and Moon-jeong Heo, and their works are completely different in format. It is an exhibition of collections of works that is organized and evokes sympathy between reason and emotion.",

                explanation: "Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he puts emphasis on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. In the world of black, all colors are mixed and it is said to contain more concentrated power and beauty than any other color. For the artist, the color of ink is a sample color made with acrylic. As can be seen in the form of artist Kim Yeon-hee's series of works, most of the works were acquired through independent research and were influenced by the 'minimal art' and 'minimal art' that were prevalent as trends in late modern art. It can be seen that efforts were made to share the spirit of 'monochrome painting' and 'conceptual art'. It can be seen that these ideas became the basis of ‘Korean monochrome painting’, in which the spirit and ideas of Eastern thought emerged as an important new alternative from a Western perspective centered on material civilization. In modern art, a phenomenon of moderation and simplification of color and composition, while emphasizing the blank space and spatiality of the picture appears due to the influence of the Eastern thought of ‘inaction’ and the Buddhist idea of ​​‘emptiness’. The purity of artist Kim Yeon-hee's paintings shows that these oriental ideas are accepted as the background for the embodiment of aesthetic value. We see that this concept is accepted and expanded in the paintings of the artist's spirit, and that materiality and media overlap and dissolve into the image of the work in the form of contingency. The symbols in artist Kim Yeon-hee's work are arranged throughout the work and appear as symbolic and lyrical images, conveying implicit meaning. It can be seen that the ‘Flowing’ and ‘Automatism’ techniques that the artist is borrowing as expression techniques are being applied as formative forms that compose the screen with freely intended physical properties. As can be seen in the works since 2015 and the text abstract works, 'language' and 'ideology', which were chosen as an alternative method to 'object art' in the early 70s, are used as an alternative to 'art' and 'statement'. It can be seen that they were also fascinated by the ‘language’ and ‘characters’ of the conceptual artists who presented them. We see that this verbal description is determined by the representation of black monochrome painting. This large-scale monochrome work seems to have reinterpreted the medium of painting and expanded its scope, based on the relationship between shape and background and the method of developing one's own aesthetics through subtle harmony of colors in a color field that is vaguely rectangular. In most of the works of these artists, we can see that the screen is composed of accidental effects due to the overlap of physical properties and media. As these characteristics are applied to the work, the paint is pushed and pulled within the canvas, and this gravity creates a trajectory of density and speed on the screen. This creates a natural blank space on the screen, and it can be seen that artist Yeonhee Kim has evolved this phenomenon with her unique color technique. Artist Kim Yeon-hee creates her own world of work with her own will and her overflowing vitality, and gives meaning and beauty to it. In the 2022 Accept exhibition by artist Kim Yeon-hee, who was invited to the Schema Museum of Art, where the simplest composition of color, plane, and line brings great resonance in different blank spaces, you can appreciate about 30 recent works from 2016.",

The world of squares, which was the icon of the artist's abstract world, is deconstructed and freely expressed through new forms of 'rhythm' and 'color' of a more free geometric abstract world. The artist's work shows another beginning through rediscovery and new exploration of concepts and methods that were not completed in the past.",

                explanation: "This project, ‘SM Smash’, is a work that becomes the cornerstone of moving the Shema Museum of Art’s planning and artist perspective beyond regional limitations to the global stage. It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store format platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that spread out into the world. Three events are scheduled to be held in the ‘Schema art museum – SM Smash’ space. 1. SM-Smash#1, which studies digital painting and digital sculpture, 2. SM-Smash#2, a participatory project and performance space, 3. SM-Smash#3, which expands networks through archiving and events. Among the three events, ' 'SM-Smash#1: Data Material' is the first exhibition of SM Smash and aims to introduce painting and sculpture artists whose works have data as a physical property and are researching a form optimized for the metaverse and organize the exhibition. I think that works that utilize the characteristics of data as a material for art or remake it as a data material in a form that suits the purpose of the work are a big environmental change and hot topic for contemporary artists. We would like to introduce the works of these leading artists on a metaverse platform that actively promotes illusion.",

Just as the surrealism we know in art history is the exact opposite of the reproduction or fantasy of an ideal state that transcends reality, Seunghoon Lee's display transforms a digital illusion that is smoother than reality into a creaky and bumpy medium. His animated paintings betray the smooth and illusory images that one usually expects from digital displays, more realistic than reality, boasting ‘naturalness’ and ‘animated’ images that come to life.",

There is a face that is not a face, removing differences in appearance that can identify a person, such as eyes, nose, mouth, or social signs, that is, signs that can guess race, gender, or class.

                explanation: "Schema Museum of Art is preparing for artist Seongmi Kim’s 12th solo exhibition ‘Afterimage of the Forest’ during this hot summer. ‘Forest’, which is the motif of the artist’s work, symbolizes ‘vitality and healing’ in life. The forest, which is both the home of human life and a resting place, serves as an inspiration from nature to the author. For artist Kim Seong-mi, ‘forest’ goes beyond a visual ‘forest’ and warns of the secrets and records it holds, and that humanity will inevitably destroy and become distant from nature as it develops into a new civilization and creates a new history. In this exhibition, various unexpected social and natural problems are presented through blue abstract flat work and video work. For the artist, the forest is a being that faces the external world as a life, and the yearning, longing, and regret for nature that the writer feels are related to the subtle world. The traces left as the colors are layered several times, the paint is absorbed, and it dries are the artist's expressions. We will present an abstract painting that shows the interaction of worldviews. In this exhibition, the artist has continued to use the forest as a motif in recent years to capture all the changes over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We hope that this will be an opportunity to find ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work.",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed depending on the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. How is the material world and the world of metaphysics related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence will this have on modern art? Also, modern art artists are still part of the material world in the generation that has the smoothest plane in human history. This exhibition was planned to examine how they exist and how they interact and work. Perhaps we understand the material particles symbolized by stones and the world of metaphysics and imagination derived from them in the most dense form? think. Artist Kim Yun-seop collects images from the flood of images, archives them day by day, and combines the contemporary art of the day on canvas to create the [Today's Contemporary Art Series]. He appropriates the images of modern art consumed through screens rather than materials to create new screen compositions and implements them in a pictorial way. Artist Byung-ho Lee is the only artist who works in three dimensions, and as a tool to create new sculptures, he first sketches using a 3D program. The sketched three-dimensional polygon is transferred back to the material, divided, and each part is reassembled and manufactured with different materials. He actively accepts the collisions and contrasts of materials that occur in this process and creates sculptures with new formative features. I think that author Cho Min-seon is the author who can most closely show the world of metaphysical imagination. Through his work, the author captures the ambivalence of humans who are interdependent but also constantly form relationships as independent entities. Various situations and complex emotions resulting from relationships are visualized using various media such as installation, video, and interactive. It is mainly shown as interactive installation work using technologies such as programming and video mapping, and also shows work incorporating photography or painting, and is also shown as a form of work that returns from data to material work. In this way, modern artists basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and produce their works again using the body represented by material. It is time to open our eyes to what significance this method has for us and how it will change in the future.",

This way of working is performed not as a completion, but as an attempt to celebrate the drawing process and stay in it as much as possible. ‘Light Seekers’ appear in Ted Chiang’s short story ‘Hell is the Absence of God’. They are pilgrims who chase the light of heaven to enter heaven in the novel's worldview where the light descends. They may be injured or die during the pilgrimage, and may be blinded by the heavenly light they believe to be salvation or fall into hell. What is faith? In the eyes of reason, the Light Seekers are foolish gamblers, but they are existential in that they act even at the risk of their own death. I feel that there is no much difference between me, who continues to paint while anticipating failure, and the light seekers who pursue the heavenly light. But unlike me, Light Seekers do not doubt salvation. Through the belief that they can enter heaven by touching the light and the existential practice that follows, they may already be saved people who feel God and live this life in hope. I don't yet know the shape of my finished painting, but I always work as if I'm praying, aiming to reach it. It's not pessimistic. However, I try to stay in the drawing process as long as possible and try to delay that ecstatic moment of salvation, which may only happen once, as much as possible.",

I unfolded the canvas and completed the painting by selecting images one by one, stacking them and filling them. Figures drawn in parts sequentially have their own flow of light and different viewpoints, so they are together but have different spatial characteristics, and they are contrasted with flat planes and three-dimensional surfaces, and planes and lines, creating a surreal composition that is connected together in the space of the painting. have it I believe that painting is the face that reflects our contemporary times. What kind of face will my contemporary image have? The image was approached with the question, and ironically, the moment the painting was drawn, it became a face of the past, becoming today's contemporary art series.",

This is to overcome the solid form and surface determined at the completion stage of the work, and shows a working attitude to present sculpture in a state of continuous flux and transformation. The materials of the work, unitized through copying, become new originals through transformation, disassembly, and recombination. Sculptures produced/derived during the work process may become independent works in themselves, or may be used as materials or objects to be reborn as another sculpture each time a new project is undertaken. This work journey takes place not only in physical space but also in virtual space through 3D scan data. The work presented before ‘Smooth Stone Field’ at the Schema Museum of Art is the ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series. The ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series is based on the methodology of Auguste Rodin, a sculptor from the late 19th century. Rodin enjoyed marcottage work, which involves recombining existing works and presenting them as new works, and in the process of this work, unused by-products were created, which Rodin called ‘abattis.’ The 'Eccentric Abattis' series allows us to accept (Rodin's) Abatti, which was left behind after its usefulness was exhausted, from a work object to a subject, and further subdivides the Abatti whose shape remains to the point where its shape has ambiguity, and then reuses it as a formative material. It is a series of combinations.",

This is visualized not only through video work, but also through various media installation methods using various objects and sensors. In this exhibition, the works <reflection, 2021> and <fragility, 2020> are combined into one to present a work with a new meaning. Specifically, it is the work of thinking about the various changing relationships in modern society and guiding the viewer into the work to form a new relationship between them and the work or to reinterpret it. Several beam projectors installed on the ceiling of the exhibition hall project toward the floor. Geometrically shaped fragments are constantly floating and change their appearance according to the data values ​​of the sensor. Additionally, there are broken pieces of mirror installed on the wall. A broken piece of mirror distorts and reflects light in space differently depending on the degree and direction of its surface. The three-dimensional and unrealistic effect created by dozens of mirror sculptures transports you to a utopian place that does not belong to any space and a Uchronian time that does not exist in reality. The mirror used as a medium is an intermediate device that reflects our appearance in reality while escaping the actualized space and inducing an experience in another dimension. Mirrors broken into different shapes trap viewers within small pieces and provide an opportunity to view themselves as different objects. And the fragmentary images reflected through the mirror constitute a dreamlike, neutral world that cannot be experienced in reality.",

                explanation: "This project, ‘SM Smash’, is a work that becomes the cornerstone of moving the Shema Museum of Art’s planning and artist perspective beyond regional limitations to the global stage. It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store-type platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that expanded into the world. SM-Smash, the online metaverse branch of the Schema Museum of Art, is holding its second exhibition after <Data Meterial>, the first exhibition that tested the possibilities of digital media. The second exhibition, <Wa are Happening>, presents an experimental exhibition in the field of performance using the Metaverse platform. Audiences enter a new world of play through Decentraland, the world's largest metaverse platform. This type of exhibition, which involves visiting the SM-Smash box office located in Decentraland (57,-83) and entering Metaberry, a new metaverse space, is the first inter-metaverse mobile exhibition in Korea and an expansion of the metaverse platform. It shows the possibility of a new form of dramatic art through the possibility of and network. Director Song Joo-ho of Diorama Vivant Theater, who was invited for this exhibition, designs and experiments with expanded forms of plays based on his unique analog sensibility. The audience will pass through the box office and enter the theater to experience a new play that stands at the forefront of modern art.",

                        text: "– Synopsis: Six actors stand on a stage simulating an excavation site. As they excavate the remains of characters who have already died and been buried in the ground, they reproduce the forgotten expressions and lost voices of the dead. – Description of work: <History / Hysterie> consists of two-dimensional videos of six actors imagining a “lost narrative” excavating remains or giving a monologue. In this work, the theme of ‘loss’ is externalized in the form of ‘footage’ referring to “lost data.” Between the way the fragmented and scattered footage is displayed in the Metaverse Theater and the way it is viewed, the audience, who have become performers and avatars, attempt to approach the “completed or already dead” original from their own perspective, the lost narrative. Various editions will be 'played' in . This landscape of restoration seeks to witness the kind of neurosis suffered as the history of a real work is transferred to the virtual world as an “avatar of the work.” History may also be a performance of neurosis. - Production intention: The impossibility of eternity, a characteristic of a play that cannot maintain a specific state between a one-time live performance and multiple reenactments, is itself a mythical act and a way of existence that resists “completion or death.” Although a play cannot reproduce death, it manages to reenact it, exploring or staying at the edge of the myth. Sometimes, when it wants to penetrate into the inside of the myth, it creates a narrative-story that it has never experienced, revealing its desire and being consumed by it. Perhaps because desire cannot reproduce death, it is better resisted through theater. Meanwhile, ‘Diorama Vibang Theater’ creates plays based on the aesthetic ethics of the irreverence of art called ‘incompleteness’, which is revealed in the characteristic of the impossibility of eternity in plays. The incompleteness referred to here does not refer to “an unfinished story,” but to “not resisting death.” Then, suddenly, I think of a play that can only be recreated by taking advantage of the characteristics of film, which can permanently fix the finished result.",

                explanation: "Artist Koo Ja-soong (1941~, Western painter) is a first-generation Korean hyperrealist artist who shows restrained still life paintings through the private space of an Eastern worldview. Artist Koo Ja-seung was born in 1941 and graduated from the Department of Painting and the Graduate School of Education at Hongik University College of Fine Arts. Starting with his first solo exhibition at Sun Gallery in 1978, he has been engaged in endless artistic activities for 44 years. Artist Jang Ji-won (1946~, Western painter) uses flowers, birds, and trees as a metaphor for nature hidden in his mind, and still creates his work through a fierce battle with himself to create his imaginary world. Artists Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won began working in Chungju in 1986 when they moved their studio to the banks of the Namhan River in Chungju. After retiring from Sangmyung University, artist Koo Ja-seung built his current studio in 2007 and continues to work in North Chungcheong Province. This exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won at the Schema Art Museum is an exhibition with a special synergy as they are a local senior artist and a married couple. It can be said that the two artists left a significant mark on the Korean art world as colleagues who communicated and stimulated each other. Although the painting styles of the two couples are different, the subject matter of their works, flowers, is something they have in common. In the fierce world of artists, the two couples have supported and supported each other for half their lives, building and expanding their own unique world of work with the beauty of new formative interpretations, the space of Eastern thought, and an Oriental perspective. Artist Koo Ja-seung paints still life paintings that are close to hyper-realism, and ordinary motifs such as glasses, liquor bottles, vases, flowers, and chests become the main characters of artist Koo Ja-seung's paintings. These objects harmonize with each encounter through their delicacy and light reflection effect, and rather than intentionally crowding many objects into the center of the canvas and reproducing or moving them, they show the restrained flow of time. In the artist's understated still life paintings, we can get a glimpse into the artist's intense mental world beyond beauty. Artist Jang Ji-won shows the hidden dimensions of nature through his own imaginative landscapes. Materials such as flowers, birds, and trees that appear in the artist's work are created using Korean paper as a basic work, repeatedly cutting and pasting, painting, scraping, and attaching Korean paper again to create the desired shape with a thick matiere effect, and acrylic, oil, and other materials such as flowers, birds, and trees appear in the artist's work. It is expressed freely using various materials such as pastel and colored pencil. The author looks into the essence of humans in nature and shows a world of healing and happiness, comfort and peace. This invitational couple exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won, held at the Schema Museum of Art, is an exhibition in which the 44-year-long world of works by Koo Ja-seung, a master of realism in North Chungcheong Province, and the 40-year-long world of artist Jang Ji-won's works face each other. The world of work by two senior couple artists who supported and communicated with each other for half their lives will be exhibited at the Schema Art Museum on October 14-11. You can enjoy it until the 13th. Through 'Breathing Still Life' by Koo Ja-seung, who maintains his unshakable position as the best artist of Korean realism, and 'Hidden 次元' by Jang Ji-won, who shows another world of still life painting that shows the imaginative landscape of nature with warm materials, This exhibition will explore the aesthetic formativeness and mental expression of previous realism and immerse yourself in the charm of original and beautiful still life paintings.",

As a connection and mediation space connecting our two chain points, it will be a space that provides liquidity and expansion to SM-Smash. We plan to design this space as a space where one can view catalogs, publications, and artists' portfolios made during the course of exhibition activities. People will be able to enter the link for each space, and artists will be able to share ideas here and interact with artists from around the world within the metaverse. Our goal is to showcase the works of young Korean artists to the world through SM-Smash#3 space and to help them create their own metaverse studio spaces, making it an art street. By helping and exchanging information and creating metaverse studios for various Korean artists, I hope that this will become a place for information exchange similar to real estate. In addition, we plan to expand participation through publicity by creating various art experience events and giving people from all over the world the opportunity to experience Korean art. We plan to plan and conduct several events to encourage the writer community and free participation.",

The culture and arts education program created by the Shema Museum of Art, in collaboration with local artists, is different from general school education and strives to provide customized culture and arts education for people of various ages. This results report exhibition is a support project for the Dream Attic Saturday Culture School - 'Catching a Floating Cloud' with artist Shin Yong-jae, a representative local sky recorder, and 'Sculpture Pouch', a one-year children's culture and arts education project with Baek Sol-moe, an abstract sculpture artist. ' This is a results report exhibition that reports on the progress and process in the form of an archive and exhibition. I believe that the exhibition is a time when participants in all programs can once again think about the importance of social arts education and the role of art museums, and establish the Shema Art Museum as a public cultural space and a space for communication with citizens. We invite you to the cultural arts education results report exhibition, which was more lively than any other year and enabled participating families and children to feel their passion.",

The Schema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists and encourage the passion of new artists for their work in order to continuously establish a balance in local art every year. This exhibition supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition, and hopes to create new challenges and opportunities for local young artists and create an art ecosystem in our region. The ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition will be held in two parts, the ‘Unstable Possibilities 1’ exhibition will feature artists Ki-tae Kim, Byeol Son, Seung-won Yoon, Sang-hee Jeon, and Gyu-bong Choi, and the ‘Unstable Possibilities 2’ exhibition will feature artists Jun-hu Kim, Yu-seung Lee, Jun-woo Lee, Yun-hee Jang, and Chi-hoon Jeon. A total of ten artists participate. In particular, as Unstable Possibility implies, writers are unstable but contain infinite possibilities. Artists visualize unstable reason and their own perception of the world in a variety of ways, and express in their works everything from the stories of individuals living their daily lives to the world we live in and their thoughts about art. These thoughts and concerns are unstable, but they are creating a new world. Artist Kim Ki-tae, who is participating in the first exhibition of Unstable Possibilities, says he wants to find a life that flows naturally. I try to find such questions through ‘Cactus’. To the author, cacti provide comfort, but at the same time, the numerous thorns are also a personal pain and the pain and suffering experienced while searching for life.",

O. K.) 2020년 제 3회 쉐마국제미술상 – 수상작가 : 창신 Cang Xin / China 제 3회 쉐마국제미술상(The 3rd Schema International Best Artist Award) 수상 작가 「창신(Cang Xin)」은 시대정신 ‘Fluxes 운동’, ‘해체주의’, ‘Cyber 미학의 정신’이 추구하는 정신에 선도적으로 실행하는 중국 현대미술을 대표하는 작가라 말을 할 수 있다. 그는 드로잉, 오브제, 설치, 퍼포먼스 등으로 중국에서뿐만 아니라 미국, 영국, 한국 등 세계 각지에서도 매우 활발하게 활동하고 있다. 그의 작품 ‘천인합일(天人合一)’ 퍼포먼스, ‘북방적 낭만주의’ 제작품, ‘기화승초(奇花昇草)’ 오브제 설치 작품, 드로잉(素描) 시리즈 작품들은 하나하나가 그의 천재적 작가의 모습을 보여주기에 충분한 작품들이다. 2009년 쉐마미술관 김재관 관장님과 우연히 만난 후, “不期而遇” 展 <베이징 사면공간 갤러리, 2010>, “和異不同” 展 <청주 쉐마미술관, 2011>, “必然的 偶然” 展 <베이징 사면공간 갤러리, 2012> 등 몇 차례의 기획전을 함께 하였고 베이징과 청주를 오가며 교류하였다. 특히 2017년 쉐마미술관 특별전으로 열린 4개국 국제교류전 “새로운 미술로서의 기억과 상상” 전에 중국을 대표하는 작가로 선정되어 참가하였다. 2020 한·중 국제미술교류전 遭遇与相处(조우여상처), “우연히 만나 다시 함께 떠나다” 전시에서도 중국 커미셔너로 Cang Xin이 참여하였다. 두 작가의 관계는 작품을 넘어 작가의 정신적 교감으로 이어져 교류하고 있으며 자신만의 정체성을 확고하게 이어나가고 있다. 이번 초대전에서 창신 작가의 2003년 작품부터 20년도 퍼포먼스 영상까지 모두 13점의 작품을 감상할 수 있다. 유감스럽게도 이 뜻깊은 행사에 ‘코로나-19’ 팬데믹으로 인하여 창신 작가가 참석할 수 없다는 것이 매우 안타깝다. 그렇지만 우리는 곧 다시 만날 수 있다는 희망과 기대를 한다.",

                explanation: "비욘드 연(蓮) (Beyond Lotus): 2021년 쉐마미술관의 첫 번째 기획초대전 ‘심재분 작가’의 ‘인드라얄라:연’ 전시는 작가가 2018년부터 최근까지 찍은 64점의 ‘연꽃’ 사진 작품들을 선보이는 전시이다. 현대미술에서 사진은 ‘기록과 재현’이라는 기본 속성을 넘어 개성적 표현이 가능해지며 작가가 대상을 어떻게 선택하느냐, 또 어떻게 보느냐에 따라 표현 가능성이 다양해지며 확장되고 있다. 심재분 작가는 ‘연꽃’을 사진에 카메라에 담으며 작가의 심층적 내면에 있는 무의식과 상상의 세계로까지 표현 영역을 확장하고 ‘연꽃’이라는 대상을 단순한 재현이 아닌 대상의 내적 표현을 찾으려 수년 동안 기록하며 깨달음의 정신적 세계로 나가는 수행으로 이어지고 있다. 전시 타이틀인 인드라얄라(Indrjala)는 이런 작가의 생각을 고스란히 담고 있다. 인드라얄라(Indrjala)는 산스크리트어로 인드라의 그물을 뜻한다고 한다. 고대 인도 신화에 따르면 인드라 신이 사는 선견성(善見城) 위의 하늘을 덮고 있고 일종의 무기로 그물코마다 보배 구슬이 박혀 있고 거기에서 나오는 빛들이 무수히 겹치며 신비한 세계를 만들어 낸다고 한다. 불교에서는 끊임없이 서로 연결되어 온 세상으로 퍼지는 법의 세계를 뜻하는 말로 쓰이며 인드라망은 불교에서 세상을 바라보는 관점이기도 하다. 심재분 작가는 ‘인드리얄라 : 연’展에서 ‘연꽃’이라는 대상을 넘어 작가만의 인드라망을 통해 인간 세상의 모습을 바라보고 있다. 우리는 저 혼자 살아가는 것 같지만 실제로는 서로 연결돼 있고, 서로가 서로를 비추고 더 나아가서는 세상과 인간과의 관계로까지 밀접한 관계 속에 존재를 재현하기 위해 ‘초 망원 렌즈’와 ‘초 광각 렌즈’를 사용하여, 눈으로는 다 보지 못하는 자연을 한 컷의 이미지에 담으며 느껴지는 초현실적인 사실을 작품화하고 또 다른 이미지를 재현하고 있다. 이번 전시에서 대상의 본질을 꿰뚫어 자신의 언어로 다시 재현한 ‘원초적 순수’, ‘순수의 정화’, ‘존재의 그림자’, ‘집착의 타락’, ‘초췌한 고뇌의 형상’, ‘균형과 형상을 찾아서’, ‘자유로운 영혼의 승화’ 시리즈 작품과 설치 작품 ‘Chaos’를 선보일 예정이다.",

                        text: "옥상에 올라가 그 날의 하늘을 바라본다. 현실과 동떨어져 보이는 공간의 이미지를 눈으로 살펴보고 정지되어 있지 않은 변화들을 순간에 일어나는 기분들로 표현한다. 하늘의 색은 시시각각 변화하고 구름의 형태 또한 일정치 않은 모습들이다. 예측할 수 없는 태도로 맞이하는 마음가짐이 긴장과 위안, 설렘을 가져 온다. 사람은 자연과 같이 살아왔지만 몫은 다른 듯하다. 자연의 모습들과 느낌들은 매순간 다르고 그려본다 해서 같아질 수 없는 색이다. 머무르지 않는 변화들이 시간의 흐름을 느끼게 해준다. 하늘을 바라보는 시간은 집중할수록 고요하다. 귀를 의심할 정도로 생활의 소음들은 잦아들고 오직 온도와 냄새 바람의 세기 자연의 소리들만이 몸을 감싸 안는다. 이런 순간 영화나 드라마에서 한번쯤 보았을 장면처럼 자신은 가만히 서 있고 주변의 모습들이 계속 변화한다. 보고 있으면 자연이 주는 시간이 느릴 때도 빠를 때도 있다. 하늘을 보며 그릴 때의 모습은 정확한 형태보다 몸의 감각으로 전달하는 분명하지 않은 생각 속에 자연스러운 붓질이 이루어진다. 붓질 자국은 자신의 감각에 맡긴다. 기분은 그런 것으로 조절되기도 하고 바라보는 저 곳에 흡수되어 가는 느낌이다. 날이 샐 무렵, 아침이 오는 기운, 정오에 눈부심, 해질녘 소리 없는 변화, 빛이 사라지는 밤 등을 매일 바라보면서 규칙적이지도 같지도 않은 나날들을 보았다. 사람과 비교하자면 매일 하루는 반복되지만 오늘과 내일이 다른 삶으로 이루어진다. 하루가 시간으로 정해져 있는데 이것 역시 자연의 흐름에 바탕을 두고 있는 것이며 사람들마다 그 날의 작은 변화들이 있다. 그렇게 다른 매일이 흘러가는 것이다. 그러한 날들이 쌓이면 한 사람의 인생이 만들어져가고 '살았다'라는 가치 있는 말이 쓰이는 것 같다. 사는 것이 저 끝이 없는 텅 빈 공간을 계속 걸어가고 있다는 생각이 든다. 구름 한 점 없는 날, 끝이 보이지 않는 저 곳을 보면 마음 한 구석이 먹먹하다. 시간이 지나면 기억이 변질되고 무뎌져가는 날들처럼 하늘을 계속 바라보고 그리는 행위는 자연스럽게 흘러가는 자신의 일과이다. 비가 온다. 감각하는 것은 구름 낀 하늘, 대체로 어두운 빛, 축축해 지는 서늘함, 빗소리 등이다. 이 분위기에 일어나는 기분들이 감정을 일으킨다. 불쾌하거나 우울해질 때도 있지만 운치가 있을 때도 있다. 비를 맞으며 그림을 그리는 부분들은 그 전에 작업하던 환겨과는 다른 움직임이다. 캔버스 안에 그런 자국들이 빗물에 뒤엉키거나 지워질 때면 우연한 재미를 본다. 비오는 날에 감정이 일어나는 상태는 그리고 있는 중의 변화를 보는 것과 같다. 내리는 비는 받아들일 수밖에 없다. 우연히 본 하늘을 매일 보게 됬다. 하늘을 그린 것도 감정의 동요가 있었을 것이다. 아름답다는 느낌도 별 다를 것 없다는 느낌도 하늘의 우연한 생김새를 본 것이다. 어떻게 생겨난 것일까라는 의문보다 일상 속에서의 삶을 바탕으로 이입되는 감정들을 하늘에 견주어 보았다. 그리고 그리는 행위로 이어질 때 삶의 응어리들에서 벗어나는 자유를 느낀다.",

                explanation: "조현애 회화 : 가상세계의 공간과 시간 구성: 새로운 생각은 어떻게 만들어지는가? 새로운 작품을 구상하고 작업과정을 거치고 작품을 완성해야 하는 작가들에게는 늘 새로운 생각과 작업에 대한 고민이 그칠 새 없다, 빈 캔버스는 현실의 세계와 대면하고 있는 또 다른 세계이기 때문이다. 그래서 개념미술가 이우환 작가는 하얀 캔버스에 붓질이 찍히는 순간 현실의 세계와 또 다른 세계가 처음으로 만나는 순간이라고 정의하였다. 그러한 철학사상이 기저가 되었기 때문인지 이우환 화백의 작품 명제는 대부분 ‘만남’ ‘조우(遭遇)’로 되어 있다. 건축가 유현준 저서 <공간이 만든 공간>에는 “빈 공간은 빛보다 먼저 존재한다. 어두운 땅 위에 하나님께서 빛이 있으라 이르시며 빛이 있었다.” 라는 구절이 있다. 영어 성경에 ‘비어 있다’는 ‘Void’라 표기되어 있다. 과학적 사고가 거의 없던 초기 문명사회 시절에는 신이 세상을 창조할 때 ‘빈 공간’인 ‘보이드 공간을 먼저 창조하고 그 이후 ’빛‘을 창조했다고 생각했다. 그것은 빈 공간이 없으면 빛조차 존재할 수 없음을 말함이다. 천재 물리학자 아인슈타인은 그가 발견한 ‘상대성 원리’에서 ‘빈 공간’을 인정하지 않는다. 그 이유는 그는 ‘빈 공간’(공기)도 물질로 정의하였기 때문이다. 그와 마찬가지로 현대미술에서 피카소의 ‘큐비즘’은 원근법을 해체시켜서 자연주의적 명암을 거부하고 환영적 공간을 없애버렸기 때문에 큐비즘의 작품에는 빈 공간이 없다. 지난 2015년 그림손 갤러리 개인전에 작품에 대하여 필자는 이렇게 말하였다. 첫째, 작가 고유의 창조적 이미지를 가져야 한다. 둘째, 그림의 내용이 반드시 서술적으로 이루어져야 할 필요가 없다. 그것은 비대상적이던 비구상적이던 비재현적이던 상상력을 유발할 수 있어야 한다. 셋째, 은유적이어야 한다. 작품에서 은유란 언어적이던 시각적이던 연관성이 있어야 한다. 이 세 가지 특징은 지금도 똑 같이 적용되는 말일 것이다. 결국 조현애의 새로운 회화는 이미지의 해체를 전제로 한 평면회화로부터 이미지를 회복시키면서 새로운 소재를 구사하게 되고 새로운 공간과 시간을 구성하여 표현하는 문제로 관심이 바뀌게 되었음을 볼 수 있다. 이차원 평면 위에 시각적 은유를 만들어내며 은유 속에 담긴 연상을 만들어내고 있는데, 여기서 등장하는 이미지들은 화면 공간 속에서 시간을 뛰어넘어 동시에 재현되고 있기 때문에 ‘공간과 시간의 구성’이라는 특징으로 설명할 수 있을 것 같다. 포스트모더니즘 이후의 특징에서 가장 다원적 구조의 복잡한 양식으로 감성(sensibility)을 중요한 표현성으로 수용하고 있다. 다원적 구조의 복잡한 양식의 특징은 analogy(類推), metaphor(隱喩), symbol(象徵), allegory(寓喩, 寓話)에 의해 묘사된 관념과 상황 그리고 체험과 일치하려고 한다. 이것은 새로운 의미와 가치에 대한 인정에서 부상되어지면서 생태학적 감성의 표현, 미래의 문제에 관심, Modernist의 무미건조한 양식에서 탈피, 자유로운 방식으로 전환된다. ‘빈 공간’의 문제나 ‘감성’의 문제나 이러한 요소들이 조현애의 작품을 형성하는 주요한 요소로 작동하고 있지 않나 생각한다. 파울 클레는 “예술이란 눈에 보이는 것의 재현이 아니며, 눈에 보이지 않는 것을 보이게 하는 겻이다.”라고 하였다. 결국 회화는 클레의 말처럼 눈에 보이지 않는 세계를 재현하는 것이다. 그리고 재현된 이미지는 아무리 똑 같이 그렸다 해도 실제가 ‘아닌’ 것이 분명하다. 조현애의 작품세계는 표본작가로 ‘르네 마그리트’와 ‘샤갈’을 떠올릴 수 있다. 재현의 문제에 있어서 샤갈의 작품세계는 초현실주의적이며 대상의 존재와 실재에 대한 탐구이고 보이는 것과 보이지 않는 것의 문제이며 현실과 환영의 문제 즉 시(視)·지(知)각의 문제라 한다면, 마그리트의 작품세계는 ‘말과 이미지’의 문제라 규정할 수 있을 것 같다. ‘말과 이미지’는 서술에 있어 단어를 대신할 수도 있고 때로는 회화에 쓰여진 이름들을 정확히 가리키기도 하고 모호하게도 하고 경우에 따라서는 반어적 메타포를 지니기도 한다. 그렇기 때문에 마그리트는 회화에서 ‘이미지’와 ‘물’과 ‘언어’의 문제를 최초로 제시한 작가로 평가되고 있다. 조현애 작품의 특징은 화면에 이미지를 설정할 ‘빈 공간’을 우선 설정한다. 그 다음 마그리트처럼 ‘이미지’와 ‘물’과 ‘언어’를 어떻게 구성할 것인가 생각하는 것 같다. 얼마 전까지 대부분의 작품들이 이미지의 해체를 전제로 한 평면회화로부터 이미지를 회복시키면서 새로운 소재를 병합시키고 새로운 공간과 시간을 구성하는 문제로 관심이 바뀌고 있음을 볼 수 있다. 이차원 평면 위에 시각적 은유를 만들어내며 은유 속에 담긴 연상을 만들어내는데 그치지 않고 ‘오브제’를 병합시킴으로 해서 ‘이미지’와 ‘물’과 ‘언어’가 화면 공간 속에서 시간을 뛰어넘어 동시에 재현되고 있기 때문에 새로운 ‘공간과 시간의 구성’이라는 특징으로 설명할 수 있을 것 같다. 미술사가 와이트(Kit White)릐 말처럼 “이미지라는 것은 추상적이다.” 그리고 “이미지는 그곳에 나타난 물건 그것이라는 것은 아니라는 것이다. 전에 그곳에 있었던 ‘物’의 개념적 또는 기계적인 복제물인 것입니다. 당연한 일 같아 보이지만, 그것은 우리들이 ‘物’을 지각하는 방법이랑 이미지를 사용할 때의 태도와 깊이 연관되어 있는 것이다. 繪畵는 여러 가지 형태를 Symbolic 하게 집약한 것에서, 그것이 의식되어지던 되어지지 않던 간에 그것은 언제나 ‘Metaphor’라는 것이다. 그것은 메타포라는 상징적 언어의 Media 로서 이고, 아트의 언어라는 것이다.” 조현애의 회화는 10여 년 전까지는 모더니즘의 추상미술의 범주에 머물러있었다, 그러나 평면에 대한 이해와 ‘빈 공간’을 인식하면서 완전히 포스트모더니즘 이후의 새로운 작품으로 탈바꿈하였음을 알 수 있다. 2015년 그림손 갤러리 개인전, 2020년 금보성 미술관 개인전에서는 계속 변화하고 발전하는 모습을 보여주고 있다. 특히 최근 작품에서는 이미지와 오브제의 결합으로 만들어지는 공간과 시간의 문제뿐만 아니라, 현대미술에서 점점 중요시 되는 생태학적 감성의 표현, 미래의 문제에 관심으로 확산시켜 더욱 자유로운 방식으로 확장될 수 있을 것으로 기대한다.",

                        text: "내 작업의 주제는 시간이다 삶이 지평이 아득한 아포리아의 세계이듯이 삶의 근거인 시간 역시 아득하다 그래서 시간은 단순한 흐름이거나 소멸되는 것이 아니다 시간은 오랜 삶의 현장이 질펀히 녹아 있는 장소이다. 일체의 기억과 흔적, 그리고 꿈과 기대가 층층히 주름 잡혀 있다 시간은 두껍다 이 시간의 두께를 어떻게 가늠할까? 나의 회화는 공간과 시간을 구성하여 이차원 평면 위에 시각적 은유를 만들어내고 은유속에 담긴 연상을 공간적, 시각적 언어로 표현하는 작업이다. 현실과 가상의 모호한 경계에서 과거와 현재와 미래의 환영적인 이미지를 재현하거나 변용하여 화면을 완성해간다. 작품 속에 등장하는 이미지들은 전혀 다른 공간과 시간에 존재하였던 사물을 동시에 혹은 비현실적으로 배치하여 시공(時空)을 초월한 초현실적 공간을 극대화하고 무한공간의 metaphor로 작용하기도 한다. 최근 2~3년의 작품 중 커다란 꽃잎 한 장이 주제가 되는 작품들이 있다. 작가에게는 작업실과 주위환경이 미치는 영향이 크다. 다행히 작업실이 전원에 있어 온갖 나무와 꽃들을 가까이 접할 수 있고 계절의 변화를 실감나게 느낄 수 있다. 매년 백모란 꽃의 크고 화려한 자태에 눈을 빼앗기던 어느 날 겨우내 움을 키우며 기다리다 막상 꽃을 피운지 열흘도 채 되지 않아 시들어 떨어지는 것을 보고 안타까운 마음에 꽃잎 한 장을 시간의 metaphor로 설정하게 되었다. 기다림에 비해 너무 짧게 피었다가 지는 것이 우리의 삶과 다를 것이 없다는 쓸쓸함의 표현이기도 하다. 올 상반기엔 보자기와 쇼핑백을 시간의 metaphor로 설정하여 새로운 작업을 시작하였다. 평면작업에서 부족한 입체감을 추가하기 위해 자작나무로 shape canvas를 만들고 오브제나 네온을 접목하여 시간의 층을 다양한 방법으로 추구하였다. 쇼핑백과 보자기는 present, gift의 상징성도 가지고 있어 시대를 아우르는 사랑과 욕망의 기표가 아닐까? 그러므로 나의 작업은 과거와 현재 그리고 미래를 아우르는, 현실과 가상의 경계가 없는 공간과 과거와 현재와 미래의 모호한 시간의 흐름을 구성한 것이다.",
