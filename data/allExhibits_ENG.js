                explanation: "Through his <Cloud Tree> and <Ideal Garden> series, artist Go-Woon Lee has projected his emotions into real spaces such as parks, forests, and the sea, depicting the psychological landscape of the utopia of healing through media such as drawings, paintings, and animations. It has been expressed through. The coloring method, which creates a unique texture through the repeated process of painting and grinding paint on the canvas, and the delicate, warm tones of the screen drawn after adding subtle sparkle to the paper, create a dreamy atmosphere in the work. In addition, the animation, produced by compiling and editing hundreds of hand-drawn drawings and adding sound with low humming, attempts to connect emotionally with the audience. Artist Go-Woon Lee's work feels extremely unrealistic yet familiar at the same time, and the images in the work seem like something we've seen in a dream at least once, evoking the viewer's dreams, imagination, and memories. This “Lullaby in the Garden” exhibition unravels the time and space of the night garden, which the artist has been focusing on, through the metaphor of a lullaby. Like the melody of a soft lullaby that guides a child from the world of consciousness to the world of dreams, this exhibition allows you to set aside the logic and tension of everyday life and experience gentle relaxation through the work.",

                        text: "Goun Lee’s work begins from each day of his life. Although it is not a complete record of daily life, where you stay and what you see and feel is important. The author tries to maintain a slight distance from contemporary acute discourse and macro issues and to capture a state that is free from thoughts arising from external factors. At first, I focused on myself as a being in the world. A field of snow far away and a woman. The sea in the distance and the people on it. The dreamlike atmosphere that seems to meet reality and fantasy, created against the backdrop of nature, is a characteristic that has persisted from the beginning of Lee Go-un's work until recently. Not only the moon rainbow, but also memories of weather such as rain, snow, and clouds, the atmosphere of seasons such as spring and winter, and unfamiliar landscapes that seem to have escaped reality even though they are reality, become the starting point of the artist's imagination that connects the inner world with the external world. With the snow and rain in the background, people with faces that become one with the ‘cloud tree’ seem to stay in an imaginary space that allows free thinking like clouds. A being whose face, which most clearly reveals its identity, has disappeared allows it to escape the limited individuality defined by social norms and common notions. In fact, situations where snow accumulates and rain occur frequently in everyday life. But these are mysterious changes. Above all, snow and rain help us escape from reality. It interferes with clear vision. It blurs the boundaries, leaves room, and affects emotions. The world demands clear divisions. However, there are times when you want to erase all sections. Rain and snow make us take our feet off reality and have time to daydream. This is how the unknown space and time is imagined. After getting married and becoming a mother, Lee Go-un began drawing as if she were singing lullabies to her children. It wasn't something I specifically intended or planned. It was not intended to address the labor or practical hardships of women who became mothers. The more he focused on himself, the more images related to children appeared in his mind. It was as natural as water flowing and seasons changing. The toys in the work serve as excellent materials for weaving imagination. The reason why works containing memories of children are set at night is also connected to imagination. As is the case with snow and rain, sharp boundaries become blurred at night. The mysterious energy of the night provides languid comfort and tranquility free from the hustle and bustle of the day. Above all, for a child, night is a time to sleep and dream. The author imagines what kind of dreamland the child will enter. The author depicts dream time. A child's dream and the author's imagination intersect. The author falls into a daydream like that. Daydreaming is an activity of the thinking self (cogito). Dreamers are the state of the soul located below existence, above nothingness, and the masters of consciousness that explore the intermediate zone between reality and unreality and induce poetic daydreaming. Daydreaming is not a dream, which is an activity of the unconscious. Dreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness persists. Consciousness sustains and guides the dream. Meanwhile, the gardens and landscapes that often appear in Lee Go-un's works also exist in everyday life, but are based on memories related to fantastic situations that seem to escape daily life and experiences at travel destinations. The space Lee Go-un creates is like a romantic heterotopia. Heterotopia, which is different from real space and is not a utopia, is a unique space disconnected from daily life, but it is a space composed of incompatible heterogeneous elements that exist in reality. This time, the author floats across the border between reality and imagination, reality and fantasy. Moments where reality and unreality overlap are repeated, creating more room for the artist's imagination. In this way, the work method, attitude, and completed works that Lee Go-un has consistently pursued since the beginning are all closely related to imagination. Imagination begins with the perception of an image. The artist's imagination transforms the images received through perception. The external space and the internal space encourage each other and grow. A poetic space is created that allows for more possibilities than objective facts, and the inner space expands. Because imagination brings to mind images that are not visible in existing images, the artist discovers and expresses something hidden deep within the image. However, daydreaming, which is the main activity of imagination, is different from contemplation, which focuses on a specific problem and seeks a logical solution. It is a mental activity that occurs naturally through the activity of imagination without any clear will. However, because daydreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness exists rather than an unconscious state such as dreaming, the author is able to place himself at the center as a thinking subject. A dream is an activity in a state that is neither completely unconscious nor completely conscious, an unreal function that does not belong to rationalistic reality, but has roots in the real world. In this somewhat dazed and comfortable state of daydreaming, the artist loosely and naturally conjures up images and daydreams. And then it unfolds in the work. Imagination, which can accept images and transform them independently, is universal, so we who look at Lee Go-un's works can also have diverse imaginations. Infinity, which can be said to be the philosophical category of daydreaming, is within us. It is connected to the expansion of existence that continues in solitude, even though real life suppresses and caution stops. The author (we) dreams of infinity in an infinite world. Let’s delve a little deeper into the warm space-time and infinite world presented by this work, which “begins and ends smoothly, free from intellectual labor.”",

                explanation: "2023 Schema Art Museum Gyemyo Year, the first exhibition of the new year ‘Ecole de Cheongju’ – Schema’s masterpiece exhibition is an exhibition of works from the collection that has another meaning. 2024 marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Schema Museum of Art. This collection exhibition is an exhibition that presents important works while thinking about the past 14 years. Works by the late artist who was a close friend of Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art. This is an exhibition planned while thinking and reminiscing about the precious works of close junior artists and artists who have participated in solo exhibitions at the Schema Art Museum. These are the collections of Ecole de Chemat, which presents paintings, photographs, and video works by a total of 13 artists. Artist Kim Jae-gwan's recent ‘Relationship’ series, among half a century of geometric abstract art works, depicts nature, breaking away from the work format that has long been approached through rational interpretation of geometric abstract structures. Rather than painting nature as a common-sense landscape, it is expressed as ‘natural phenomena’ – ‘light,’ ‘sound,’ ‘color,’ and ‘rhyme.’ Kim Young-bae (1947-2001) was a late artist who considered a unique methodology that served as a bridge between modernism and postmodernism. He experimented with new dimensions of painting by colliding pop and realism simultaneously, clashing lines and surfaces, concepts and layers, etc. He was a writer. He had an open attitude to various fields and was very interested in comics, so he served as a professor in the Department of Comics at Sangmyung University and trained many younger students. The “Untitled” series creates screens with repeated patterns through a combination of language such as figurative images and geometric patterns. Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he focuses on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. Artist Kim Jae-nam's <Lost Landscape> painting series collects sea images of specific locations containing cultural and social memories and presents them in an incomplete state through “defamiliarization.” In order to evoke memories as an interpretant, black charcoal is painted and rubbed repeatedly on the canvas countless times, replacing it with a simple black and white color plane involving the body. For artist Kim Seong-mi, the forest is an entity, and in recent years, the author has continued to use the forest as a motif to capture all aspects of change over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We search for ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work. Artist Park Jin-myeong is a representative modern orientalist artist in Cheongju. He expresses images that come to mind in his paintings. Certain scenes that pass by him in passing produce other memories and images, and by repeating the overlapping of those moments, they become a new scene and an afterimage. engraved with The image of the darkness with the moon floating on it and the moment below it overlapping and playing over and over again permeates the screen as a single scene. Artist Shim Jae-bun goes beyond the object ‘lotus flower’ and penetrates the essence of the object and recreates it in his own language. In order to reproduce the invisible existence of nature and humans, ‘ultra-telephoto lens’ and ‘ultra-wide-angle lens’ are used to capture nature that cannot be seen with the naked eye in a single image, creating a work of art that feels like a surreal fact. Artist Lee Hong-won strongly reveals Korean aesthetics through dazzling colors. The tigers and human figures that appear in the painting are based on tradition, but also imply accessibility to modern art. Freedom of subject matter or expression, simplification or exaggeration, boldness, and humorous aesthetics and humor are the main characteristics of Hongwon Lee's work, and the classics and modern times, the world of myth and the world of reality coexist in synchronicity. Artist Eunsoo Lim is an artist who embodies women's sensuality and senses with a sense of feminism. Due to her unique self-consciousness, she moves further away from the cogs of modernism and expresses her own critical awareness and new drawings through movement. From 2020 until recently, the artist has presented the current social, climate, and environmental phenomena through the performance ‘I am here now’ with a unique sense of comfort and circulation. In ‘I Am Here Now 7’, the author enters and joins the water circulation process of Daecheong Lake. And by expanding the self, it becomes an agent and mother of life, presenting through symbolic tools and actions what we truly value and protect in this era. Artist Jeon Yeon-il (1945-2021) captures the restoration of humanity lost due to the development of industry in modern society, and at the same time uses the five cardinal colors that our people have long revered and used very closely in their daily lives as the subject matter of his work. The five colors present modernized visualization works based on the joys, sorrows, etc. of our lives. The visualized work appears shamanistic yet primitive. Kisan artist Jeong Myeong-hee has unfolded the story of Geumgang and the universe with a variety of materials and colors, focusing on Hanji and ink. In recent years, he has been talking about the fundamentals of life using black ink on a white background, comparing it to the spirit of literary painting. The birds of Kisan fill the screen, appearing in black ink or as blank space. Lee divides the canvas with a fundamental form resembling a cross, visualizing life as freely flying. Artist Cho Hyun-ae captures ‘time’ on canvas. The artist's work, where lost time and present time coexist, contains the accumulation of time in the space the artist creates. In particular, in the artist's virtual space, images of the past and present coexist, and landscape paintings, genre paintings, and Western masterpieces from the Joseon Dynasty come together to form multiple layers of space and overlap. The coexistence of past and present within a two-dimensional plane forms the artist’s own ‘surreal’ world and creates a visual metaphor. Artist Choi Min-geon expresses our enjoyment of wandering between virtuality and reality, subject and object, due to the ambiguity of boundaries. The dog that creates an optical illusion on the screen blurs the boundary between virtuality and reality, and expresses the appearance of dogs, the most familiar of humans and other animals, making us feel different from us and at the same time feel homogeneous.",

                explanation: "The Soft Life exhibition invites artists who instill a warm or new perspective on those around them without being shaken while living in a dynamic modern society. The four artists who look at the various peripheries of everyday life and create new images using everyday events and images make us think that they are not only creators, but also existential in themselves. Their methodology, which is revealed while composing events and images, consists of figurative painting and seeks to enter each person's world. Artist Park Hae-bin travels between Jeju Island and Cheongju, accumulating imprinted images and various events in her paintings. His works, which expose the illusion of the flat surface or reproduce dense compositions with small strokes, attempt to go beyond the limits of representation and enter a new world of representation, experimenting with its methodology. His work, which collects images from around him and devotes himself to various methods of painting, evokes unfamiliarity and curiosity in the audience. Artist Minjeong Seo deals with events and images by intersecting the dog's gaze with her own. It can be inferred that it took a long time for the various delicate emotional events and chunks of images left in the mind to be finalized and composed as his material. He composes landscapes containing the wild nature and origins of plants, constructs the landscape of the mind, and reveals images as if stacking them up using the unique methodology of oriental painting, layer by layer. Artist Gyu-seon Lee finds and expresses images that resonate with his psychological environment between his repetitive daily life and the landscapes that come and go. The whirlpool of the Mindless Stream, the scenery of Cheongju, and the characters help us infer his harsh, dry, yet living world. His realism shows himself unfiltered, with quick strokes and expressions. Artist Cho Min-ah unfolds on screen the contradictions, absurdities, and jokes that occur in everyday life. He envisions several fragmentary events, expresses them, and expands them. On these screens, the audience can watch him perform his unique work and see the artist's imaginary trajectory. We want to show the world of today's painters through the lives of the four artists above, as they gently unfold them.",

                        text: "Over a long history, the landscape we live in has undergone many changes. Even at this moment, the landscape is changing. For painters of the past, landscapes have constantly been the subject matter of their works. As a painter living in modern times, I always worry about what kind of landscape to draw and how to paint it. During the two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent time looking more intently at the world around me. It was an opportunity to go into nature where no one was around, meditate, and have a more diverse visual experience. The landscape I see and draw is on the border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction, familiarity and unfamiliarity. Based on my unique visual experience, I reconstructed the landscape of reality where the heterogeneous emotions of familiarity and unfamiliarity coexist, and created cross-sections of the landscape at the psychological border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction through two-dimensional painting work. I want to show you. This clearly originates from visual perception of the real world, but it is not simply a reflection of real space, but creates another space through mental processes. Through a landscape that seems to contain a hidden story that cannot be fully known just by looking at it, we can look at things that we could not or have not seen in reality due to familiarity, and psychologically understand the heterogeneous emotions such as familiarity and unfamiliarity that exist in each individual's subconscious. We aim to arouse curiosity about boundaries.",

That may not be the case, but if you only pursue something different every time, that would also be close to a lie. That's what life is like. It's ordinary. However, even in that moment, even in an ordinary day, there are definitely times when you discover something shining. Numerous stories, conversations, passage of time, repetitive daily life and faces of groups. An image, that is, a certain image. Big and small everyday experiences and pieces of life that are scattered, broken, and emerging. image. Because of that image, I feel pain that I don't need to feel and struggle to hold on to it. The tough stories of life and the people in those stories that sometimes make you feel shut out and sometimes feel grateful. Something that cannot be resolved from embodied moments is because of images. I struggle because I want to recall that image, capture it, and express it. Relationships with many people and something invisible. A Self-Portrait in which the qualities of the relationship and encounter intersect and the physical properties are mixed, but this is not as intended. Confronted self-portrait. Life situations that cannot be avoided or ignored. Moments that must always be encountered in an organic form. Maybe I didn't want to draw myself. I wanted to express it in some other form, but I may also have faced limitations in my own objectivity. The subtle and generative expressions of a knife's touch or an oil painting, and the intersection of physical properties form a certain shape - it is an image, but it does not constitute an image - to achieve something else. Because the action and method were not intended or recognized movements, the direction of the brush moving between strokes manifests itself as meaningless brush strokes with an abstract nature. It sounds obvious, it's obvious, but it's an ordinary and natural thing to live. Life and daily life that are like an unavoidable experience in life and an organic living life. A vibrant life where cells come together, scatter, and move. Organic relationships that are inevitable and sometimes petty. The struggle to find and obsess over pictoriality within that ‘organic relationship.’ It is an image that is close but also far away. A self-portrait drawn like that. So anyway, I will draw again. I will probably draw again in this inseparable relationship, as if I were living a life that I could not avoid or ignore. The self-portrait I draw like that may not be a self-portrait.",

                        text: "Personal attitudes that constantly change depending on the situation, fluid value judgments, and the way we currently live in balance as if weighing scales always create dynamic energies. I thought that the cracks and harmony that occurred within it were natural things that came from different people living together. Reminiscent of a dream-like situation where some people live in the future and some people live in the past and the present intersects, I started thinking about those who are waiting in a messy space for something in the future that will not come, or for something that can change the present. Just like Tetris blocks of different shapes are put together and destroyed, we wanted to tell the story of our daily lives and reality in the relationship between individuals who own the present and the relationships surrounding them, despite the complexity of coexisting with others. Symbols or objects with symbolic meaning appear, but there is a universal symbol that everyone recognizes, and when I think about it and make it meaningful, I draw those elements in the picture. Working while creating allegory is attractive because it has a double meaning, but it is not the main element of my work. There are cases where colors or lines are introduced as figurative images to harmonize the screen composition. Because the work comes out of that process, there is a narrative, but there seem to be parts that are not understood. Although causal relationships and connection points between objects and people are important, the basic foundation for their combination begins with a sense of formative balance. Although it is not understandable at a glance, I hope that it will be seen as a personal narrative or as a work that reminds us of our current lives, using the situation, color, and atmosphere shown in the painting as a clue.",

                        text: "Recent work is an attempt to attach the idea that ‘the world is constantly broken and rebuilt again’ into the images and working process of each painting. I question whether the large and small violence we experience, alienation from lack of communication, emptiness, or complex and confusing scenes and fears that are difficult to interpret may be a very obvious order or an axis toward balance, albeit disturbing. Through my work, I am struggling between ambivalent things, being alienated, hurt, and unable to do either this or that, such as communication and non-communication, ideal and reality, open and closed, the desire to speak and the desire to be silent, the positivity and positivity applied to the same event. Pay attention to things like negative attitudes and the emotions at the time. The ink and ink drawings move toward breaking the object, and the color pigments (powder paint) jostle against each other in a movement to find the object, but the boundaries naturally collapse during the work process. Through the process of repeatedly breaking and putting back together, we ask ourselves how we can make meaning of the fragmented and confusing structure of the world and unclear experiences and memories. I have expressed countless moments of alienated emotions and feelings, such as individual and universal hardships in life, various pains and wounds, repeated failures, and idling, by borrowing the lush structure of untouched nature. There are conflicting impulses in everything, and we are constantly concerned about contradictions, trying to engage with them, organize them, understand them, and think about what might be better. That fight can be expressed in many different languages, but to me, it feels most clearly as the force trying to fragment and the force trying to build. Part of my world is broken and experienced loss due to certain events, and only after going through the process of reassembling or accepting it, that is, the process of building, can I move on to the next journey. Perhaps the process of fragmentation and construction itself is movement. What is clear is that breaking and fragmenting do not represent negativity, or conversely, building does not represent positivity. These are like different signals that cause things to move in slightly different directions and change shape.",

                explanation: "Bang Hyo-seong's work uses borderless language, crossing the boundaries of place and time, consciousness and unconsciousness, solemnity and kitsch, and philosophy and episode. All beings who think according to the order of creation are born with meaning, and within a given period of time, that meaning may be discovered or disappear for a moment. In a world where the visible and the invisible coexist, I work to reveal the visible and the invisible. All living things and the material world have a given time. Nothing is permanent, just long and short, and it repeats creation and extinction. The author talks about thoughts about all things located in space and time in the language of transcending boundaries. Everything changes. By time. The phenomena that have emerged in the present time speak across the material world and the spiritual world. The time of now includes eternity and may disappear after a while. I spend a long time thinking about what the essence of the object I am pursuing is. Essence is something that comes before recognition, and there is a bias between essence and non-essence. Essence cannot take precedence over existence. Existence exists as existence and non-existence, but its essence is nothing more than a momentary perception that cannot be defined in time. What do we see, feel, and perceive, whether it is an object or a mental thing? Perception has imperfections, illusions, prejudices, absurdities, and ambiguities. Regarding the fact that the world of material, which is only a part of the world of spirit, is easily visible to the eye, I question whether the world of spirit is obsessed with prejudice that obscures its essence due to the fixation of ideas. My work gives meaning to the inherent properties of materials. The essence of my objects or philosophy may also be another essence interpreted by me. There is an instinctive desire to pursue eternity in time that repeats creation and extinction. Everything disappears with time. As an invested being, everything, including me, forms a dynamic structure in the relationship between the visible and the invisible in the material and spiritual world. It is a work that materializes spiritual things through formative language. Think about what art placed in eternal time is trying to show. Materials that exist in the moment have value as works of art created wearing the clothes of imagination. This existence also exists only for a moment as it heads toward extinction. Various symbols are borrowed and used in my work. There are many formative elements that symbolically express things that arise in latent consciousness through image collection. Humans create and use symbol systems to communicate with each other. Ambiguous symbols of inability to communicate are sometimes used. These are things written as formative images. This exhibition is based on the phenomenology of mental communication in symbol systems. It is the work of replacing material with mental and mental with material. Materials imaged in a minimalistic work style through drawings and some installations. I want to show the spiritual value and structure of the material. For Sartre, existence precedes essence. This means that essence changes with time, and recognition of essence gives meaning to existence. However, perception is incomplete and is a process that takes place in time. Cognition is a part of the essence and is placed within the scope of the world through reason. Existence is the fact that it exists, and it exists in meaninglessness, such as a certain role, personality, direction, etc. Having meaning in existence is the essence of its existence, and that essence becomes explanatory. All beings change over time and their essence also changes. Essence is named by its use and given meaning by the language in which it is named. A being whose purpose is unknown or unfamiliar can be explained as existing outside the world, or in other words, an inexperienced being. However, since existence and non-existence have a counterpart, it can be a relationship between the immediate and the for-itself. Rationality is a subset of absurdity. In other words, complete cognition or rationality does not exist. Because the essence changes, a perfect combination is impossible. In the human world, language and emotions are communicated through an incomplete recognition system due to imperfect communication, and communication is also a broken part of recognition. we all know I understand. It gives legitimacy to the fiction and completes communication. However, there is no language that perfectly expresses our thoughts. ‘Be silent about things you cannot speak of,’ says Wittgenstein.",

                explanation: "This year, the Schema Museum of Art celebrates its 14th anniversary. For the past 14 years, the Schema Museum of Art, as a representative contemporary art museum in the region, has been pursuing art that breathes with the new era and the future and exhibitions that converge with other fields. In addition, it reflected the trends of the times and social phenomena, established the identity of the museum through various thematic exhibitions and international exchange exhibitions for the development of contemporary art in the Cheongju region, and established itself as a representative private art museum in Korea beyond the region. Since opening in 2009, the Schema Museum of Art has strived to serve as a regional international exchange center by hosting various contemporary art exhibitions. The 10-year narrative of the Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition began with the 1st Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition ‘New ASIA·Sympathy & Difference’ held on November 14, 2014. In particular, the international exchange exhibition began with Governor Lee Si-jong's love of art and his wish to create a representative international contemporary art exhibition in Cheongju. Without this interest and support from Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City, the current 10 years of international exchanges would not have occurred. As we welcome the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, I would like to express my deep gratitude once again, as it began with the decision of former Governor Lee Si-jong. In addition, we would like to once again thank Chungcheongbuk-do Governor Kim Young-hwan and Cheongju City Mayor Lee Beom-seok for their help in hosting the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition. ‘10 years’ is called ‘Decade’ in English. There is a deep metaphor latent in these words. In other words, the word 10 years is used in the West to mean, “A new paradigm begins in 10 years,” just as in Korea there is a saying, “Even rivers and mountains change in 10 years.” 2014 1st – New ASIA · Sympathy & Difference 2015 2nd – After the 90’s Tanamura·Jinmok era, Korean and Japanese contemporary art and about the present 2016 3rd – New dream New future 2017 4th – After Hyecho – Korea · Communication of Indian Cultures 2018 5th – Korean-French Contemporary Art ‘New Dialogue’ 2019 6th – French International Exchange Exhibition ‘2019 New Dialogue’ 2020 7th – Korea-France Korean Artists 2021 8th – Korea-Japan International Exchange Exhibition - Climate of Dialogue Again 2022 9th – New Coordinates of Korean-China Contemporary Art 2023 10th – Retrospective of Cheongju International Contemporary Art Decade and Prospects for a New Future Meanwhile, Asian Exchange Exhibition, Korea-China-Japan Exhibition, Korea-China Exhibition, We have held quite a few international exchange exhibitions, including the Korea-Japan Exhibition, Korea-India Exhibition, Korea-Netherlands Exchange Exhibition, Korea-Bosnia Exchange Exhibition, and Korea-France Exchange Exhibition. However, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the format of the exhibition changed and the mechanism of the exhibition changed to a new pattern using online video media. After such a difficult time, I feel truly fortunate and happy that all the participating artists were able to gather together for the 23rd year of the international exchange exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art in Cheongju. The 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition features 10 Korean artists (Jae-gwan Kim, Jeong-hee Kim, Jae-nam Kim, Yoon-hee Seo, Jae-bun Shim, Sang-wook Moon, Eun-soo Lim, Ik-gyu Choi, Hyo-seong Bang, and Eun-young Heo) as well as participants from China, Japan, Thailand, India, the Netherlands, and Bosnia. 11 people (Cang Xin, Chen Gang, Uno Kazuyuki, Hasegawa Ichirou, Kongsak Gulglangdon, Thawatchai Changkwien, 21 authors, including Ajitvar Kumar Douglas, Ravi Ranjan, Pietertje van Splunter, Jessy Rahman, and Jusuf Hadẑifejzović It is an international contemporary art festival in which artists participate. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Schema Museum of Art hosting an international contemporary art exhibition. Among the foreign artists participating in this international exhibition, Cang Xin (China) and Jusuf Hadžifejzović (Bosnia) are already internationally renowned. The 10 Korean artists also comprised of those who have been evaluated as the most creative artists in international exhibitions. Therefore, I have no doubt that this exhibition will be a ‘Decade’ that looks back on the past 10 years and at the same time promises a new 10 years. We would like to once again express our deepest gratitude to Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City for their cooperation for this exhibition.",

                explanation: "2023. Late Aspect Exhibition - Beautifully Thinking Art In 2023, the Late Aspect Contemporary Art Association plans to hold an exhibition under the theme of ‘Beautifully Thinking Art.’ Currently, before we have even escaped the coronavirus crisis, we are facing a society that is rapidly changing again due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. All people on Earth feel threatened by an unstable future. Nevertheless, we must face these overall problems and phenomena, overcome them, accept them, and find a way out by combining them with our respective realities. This may be because life changes, continues, and deepens under any circumstances. What is the vitality that instills the will to live in an unsettling reality? It can be said that fundamental introspection is necessary in each person's own position. As the biggest core of accepting the variations and mutations of the art ecosystem, we plan to organize an exhibition with the meaning of ‘meeting a new era with beautifully thought-out art.’",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed according to the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. The 'Smooth Stone Field' exhibition explores how the material world and the world of metaphysics are related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence this has on modern art. Modern art artists are the generation with the smoothest surface in human history. This exhibition examines how things still exist as part of the material world and how they interact and work. The 'Smooth Stone Field 1' exhibition features four artists, Kim Man-sun, Kim Yun-seop, Lee Byeong-ho, and Cho Min-seon, who basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and use the body represented by material to show what significance this method has for us and what methods it will take in the future. It was a time to open our eyes to the times and it was an exhibition to think about. Smooth Stone Field 2, which continues for 23 years, is an exhibition that reconsiders the modern flatness with a monitor, represented by rare earth elements, as the surface. This is to examine whether the consideration of the two-dimensionality created by humans since ancient times can be interpreted into the realm of art and to deal with artists who use it to present their work using new methodologies. Artist Minjeong Geum focuses on creating new surface compositions by mixing the surface of the monitor with materials such as wood and stone. All of her sculptures present a new form of sculptural sculpture by actively revealing material properties taken from nature. As a first-generation Korean media artist, artist Kim Jun has used the topic of tattoos to assess the issue of expression where an individual's identity is revealed to the surface. As a media work created with a 3D program, it can be said to represent data properties before NFT. Author Yunseong Lee is one of the most active NFT artists of his time and is creating a new myth of flatness by substituting otaku culture into mythology. He is at the cutting edge of NFT work with his continued interest in online virtual worlds. It uses stories produced from Greek and Roman myths and legends as a motif, and uses expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga and moe as its format. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. Seungcheol Ok is an artist who creates large-scale paintings and sculptures that reveal the expressions and faces of characters, and experiments with what kind of visual situations they create in online and virtual environments. The artist, who is also famous for collaborating with various genres, transforms new experiments with the flat surface into various forms of collaborative works. In modern times, flatness is not a very rare space. However, the newly expanded concept of flatness is progressing beyond online and through conversion into data, with different physical properties. We pay attention to how contemporary art works interact with and communicate with audiences using new and changing materials, and reconsider the flatness of modern times through the works of four participating artists: Minjeong Geum, Jun Kim, Yunseong Lee, and Seungcheol Ok. I want to see it.",

                        text: "The 2023 series of works used a material called concrete, a symbol of modern urban industrialization. My concrete frame is also a small symbol of urban architecture. By taking an image of a specific wall, the natural phenomena (wind movement, light and shadow movement) and light and shadow movements collected at that location are converted into data and reacted to the movement of the video image. Then, the video result is mixed with the concrete sculpture frame. In addition, in 2021, a video created by filming the natural phenomenon of a specific place called 'Soswaewon' in Damyang and reacting to the image of the building of that place will be presented along with sculpture and formative elements inspired by the actual building. It was produced by mixing and matching videos. Natural phenomena are areas that humans cannot control. However, in this day and age, we have reached an era where computers can reproduce human emotions and natural phenomena. I had an interesting thought, “Wouldn’t it be possible in the future to predict, prevent, and change natural phenomena called natural disasters?” Natural phenomena that are closely related to human emotions sometimes provide realistic data for human survival. Technology affects both art and science.",

                        text: "“Ok Seung-cheol’s works, which seem to repeat the same thing every time, start from the belief that something new can be created through repetition. This belief clashes with the limitations of various contemporary production technologies every time his icons are converted/circulated into multiple media. In other words, when his paintings become sculptures or mirrors, when his paintings become images, and when his paintings are transferred to other canvases, the shapes hover between ideal and reality, subtly changing or weathering.”_Jeong Hyeon <Moo. -Excerpt from the Patina of the Time-Space-Continuum> Artist Ok Seung-cheol has been dealing with the issue of originality from the perspective of the post-digital era from the beginning of his career to the present. By using digital images as originals to print and share not only traditional media such as paintings and sculptures, but also the boundaries between reality and virtuality, and art and non-art, the irony of the intersection of light (digital original) images and heavy (art work) images is highlighted. The process in which an image is not fixed in one form, but interacts with it inside and out, materializing it into various forms and textures, and the coexistence of so-called lightness and seriousness created by the printed outer shell (a work of art that emphasizes infinitely replicable digital images and uniqueness) We present work that examines the meaning of originality from a new perspective by emphasizing the contradictions. In this exhibition, the artist thought of and organized the small exhibition hall itself as a format of a work rather than each work individually. From the flat painting <Portrait, 2023> to the video of <Never Again, 2018> projected on a projector, and the pair of mirrors that reflect it <Outline, 2022>, the flat-shaped multi-media work is composed to create a visual effect of various thin thicknesses. Presented to the audience. As the artist intended, it encourages people to experience appreciation and interpretation of points that cannot be satisfied with the physical form due to the limitations of flatness. In particular, <Face, 2023>, a double-sided relief in the form of a compressed flat sculpture without a frontal face, is a work in which only the same back view is shown repeatedly, without showing the face that the title suggests. By intentionally creating a feeling of frustration, the work questions the limitations of the flat image on the monitor screen and its essence. Additionally, the border, which is compressed with many layers stacked on top of each other, has its limitations.",

                        text: "I am interested in expressions revealed in old narratives and contemporary visual culture. Stories produced from myths and legends such as Greek and Roman mythology are used as motifs, and expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga or moe are used as the form. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. [Torso] was inspired by a damaged ancient Greek sculpture and the final scene of the theatrical version of the Japanese animation <Ghost in the Shell (1995)>. New images discovered among the destroyed bodies were transformed into a series of works, colliding with various elements such as gushing or flying blood drops, sparkling or exploding effects, and swirling space. [The Three Graces], a large painting based on the motif of the Three Graces from Greek mythology, has been a subject that has long inspired the artist. The work was done by referring to the most typical pose of the Three Graces and the characteristics of pretty girl cartoon characters. This work, which consists of ten pieces of canvas that come together to form one large screen, was created while thinking about what the images seen through palm-sized comic books or TV media would look like when they became the main characters of a large painting. The [Medusa] series, created as a series of paintings and digital sculpture videos, began with a single drawing. The drawings are the results of a process in which the drawings are produced as classic animation-style paintings, and then the virtual digital three-dimensional works created based on these are finally printed on a 3D printer and become physical sculptures. If paintings in the past were various attempts to reproduce reality on a flat surface, I thought that currently we are in the process of experimenting with how to reconstruct the already flat world or expand it into a new space.",

As I was walking along Naesudong-ro 102beon-gil, which I pass every day, without looking at the floor, I slowly began to notice things that I had considered indifferent. I looked closely at the low stone walls of various shapes and the weeds growing between the gaps in the sidewalk blocks. Walking slowly became my daily routine, wondering how I could grow through all that. Things that had been invisible until now began to appear. Falling leaves, cats leisurely passing by, the sound of footsteps of people passing by... It was a new feeling for me, who always walked looking straight ahead. And the weeds that had bloomed with persistent vitality suddenly began to look sad and beautiful. And I started drawing one by one the weeds I saw while walking along the path.",

                explanation: "The Schema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists who are consolidating their emotional inner self through paintings and to new artists who have just graduated or are about to start a new beginning. In order to maintain a sustainable balance in local art and build an art ecosystem, the Shema Art Museum holds a special event for young artists every year. Proceed. The 2023 Unstable Possibilities Exhibition is an exhibition that supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists and hopes to create an artistic ecosystem in our region by providing an opportunity for new challenges for local young artists. As Unstable Possibility implies, young writers are unstable, but contain infinite possibilities. We get a glimpse of new possibilities through the exhibition of young artists who visualize their unstable reason and their own perception of the world in various ways and express their thoughts about the world and art in their works, from the stories of individuals living in their daily lives. I want to see it. I would like to focus on the perspectives of young artists who have just graduated and are consolidating their emotional inner self through paintings by combining the cross-section and artist's perspective with the environment surrounding them and the artist's consciousness to create new creations. Part 1, who builds his own world by revealing aspects of life using fragmentary materials, Se-eun Kim, Soo-wan Kim, Yu-bin Kim, Ji-yeon Seo, Hae-in Shin, Eun-jeong Oh, Seon-jae Yoon, Do-hoon Lee, Ha-neul Lee, Hyeong-jun Jin Part 2 So-young Kwon, Do-hoon Kim, Ji-hoon Kim, Gyu-bong Shim, Seung-ji Lee , Kiyu, Jeong Young-hoon, Jeong Ji-yong, Han Ye-jin, and Hong Myeong-gi. We would like to introduce a total of 20 young writers.",

Reason and emotion have maintained an absolute mutual relationship in modern art, and works are always progressing by repeating the dominance between reason and emotion. Participating artists include 16 artists: Seo-yeon Kim, Young-bae Kim, Jae-kwan Kim, Sang-wook Moon, Young-dae Park, Jin-myeong Park, Myeong-hee Shim, Jae-bun Shim, Seok-gyu Yoo, Seong-su Lim, Eun-su Lim, Yeon-il Jeon, Myung-hee Jeong, Hyun-ae Jo, Young-seop Han, and Moon-jeong Heo, and their works are completely different in format.

                explanation: "Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he puts emphasis on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. In the world of black, all colors are mixed and it is said to contain more concentrated power and beauty than any other color. For the artist, the color of ink is a sample color made with acrylic. As can be seen in the form of artist Kim Yeon-hee's series of works, most of the works were acquired through independent research and were influenced by the 'minimal art' and 'minimal art' that were prevalent as trends in late modern art. It can be seen that efforts were made to share the spirit of 'monochrome painting' and 'conceptual art'. It can be seen that these ideas became the basis of ‘Korean monochrome painting’, in which the spirit and ideas of Eastern thought emerged as an important new alternative from a Western perspective centered on material civilization. In modern art, a phenomenon of moderation and simplification of color and composition, while emphasizing the blank space and spatiality of the picture appears due to the influence of the Eastern thought of ‘inaction’ and the Buddhist idea of ​​‘emptiness’. The purity of artist Kim Yeon-hee's paintings shows that these oriental ideas are accepted as the background for the embodiment of aesthetic value. We see that this concept is accepted and expanded in the paintings of the artist's spirit, and that materiality and media overlap and dissolve into the image of the work in the form of contingency. The symbols in artist Kim Yeon-hee's work are arranged throughout the work and appear as symbolic and lyrical images, conveying implicit meaning. It can be seen that the ‘Flowing’ and ‘Automatism’ techniques that the artist is borrowing as expression techniques are being applied as formative forms that compose the screen with freely intended physical properties. As can be seen in the works since 2015 and the text abstract works, 'language' and 'ideology', which were chosen as an alternative method to 'object art' in the early 70s, are used as an alternative to 'art' and 'statement'. It can be seen that they were also fascinated by the ‘language’ and ‘characters’ of the conceptual artists who presented them. We see that this verbal description is determined by the representation of black monochrome painting. This large-scale monochrome work seems to have reinterpreted the medium of painting and expanded its scope, based on the relationship between shape and background and the method of developing one's own aesthetics through subtle harmony of colors in a color field that is vaguely rectangular. In most of the works of these artists, we can see that the screen is composed of accidental effects due to the overlap of physical properties and media. As these characteristics are applied to the work, the paint is pushed and pulled within the canvas, and this gravity creates a trajectory of density and speed on the screen. This creates a natural blank space on the screen, and it can be seen that artist Yeonhee Kim has evolved this phenomenon with her unique color technique. Artist Kim Yeon-hee creates her own world of work with her own will and her overflowing vitality, and gives meaning and beauty to it. In the 2022 Accept exhibition by artist Kim Yeon-hee, who was invited to the Schema Museum of Art, where the simplest composition of color, plane, and line brings great resonance in different blank spaces, you can appreciate about 30 recent works from 2016.",

The 15 artists of the Aspect Contemporary Art Association coexist with rapidly changing nature, face current problems and phenomena face-to-face, overcome and accept the past time covered by the shadow of COVID-19, and seek a way out by combining with each other's reality. do. Mauro Guillen Wharton School, author of ‘2030 Axis Shift’, says COVID-19 will not end. It was mentioned that the world is facing a more profound and massive qualitative change. Also, Charles Darwin said, ‘Life adapts and changes to the environment in order to survive.’ As if in response to this, many changes occurred in our society during the pandemic, and it became a time when we had to find new ways to survive. Participating in this exhibition are 15 artists who are members of the Late Aspect Contemporary Art Club: Jae-gwan Kim, Roy Kim, Seong-mi Kim, Young-ran Kim, Yu-jin Kim, Jin-myeong Park, Jae-bun Shim, Seung-eon Oh, Young-mi Won, Kyung-hwa Lee, Eun-su Lim, Baek-soon Jang, Min-geon Choi, Ik-gyu Choi, and Hee-jun Han.",

                        text: "Artist Jaikwan Kim's geometry is not a visible entity, but an abstract entity. The world of squares, which was the icon of the artist's abstract world, is deconstructed and freely expressed through new forms of 'rhythm' and 'color' of a more free geometric abstract world. The artist's work shows another beginning through rediscovery and new exploration of concepts and methods that were not completed in the past.",

                explanation: "This project, ‘SM Smash’, is a work that becomes the cornerstone of moving the Shema Museum of Art’s planning and artist perspective beyond regional limitations to the global stage. It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store format platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that spread out into the world. Three events are scheduled to be held in the ‘Schema art museum – SM Smash’ space. 1. SM-Smash#1, which studies digital painting and digital sculpture, 2. SM-Smash#2, a participatory project and performance space, 3. SM-Smash#3, which expands networks through archiving and events. Among the three events, ' 'SM-Smash#1: Data Material' is the first exhibition of SM Smash and aims to introduce painting and sculpture artists whose works have data as a physical property and are researching a form optimized for the metaverse and organize the exhibition. I think that works that utilize the characteristics of data as a material for art or remake it as a data material in a form that suits the purpose of the work are a big environmental change and hot topic for contemporary artists. We would like to introduce the works of these leading artists on a metaverse platform that actively promotes illusion.",

The artist, who previously created balloon sculptures made by injecting air, uses fabric that gives the illusion of metal to create futuristic sculptures that give the illusion of stainless steel sculptures. His work repeatedly appears and disappears with the sense of volume and balance of traditional sculpture. Because he uses 3D programs in the formativeness of his inflator sculptures, his sculptures naturally evolve into the world of digital and NFT.",

There is a face that is not a face, removing differences in appearance that can identify a person, such as eyes, nose, mouth, or social signs, that is, signs that can guess race, gender, or class.

This exhibition is an exhibition in which 18 mid-career and young artists from Korea and China will participate in the world's chaotic time called COVID-19, and will examine and view changes in individual art worlds and contemporary art in general through experiments with various media and materials. It is an exhibition of communication. Korean artists participating in this exhibition include Kim Jae-gwan, Park Young-hak, Park Jin-myeong, Lee Gyu-sik, Jin Ik-song, and Choi Min-geon, who are based in Cheongju; Park Seung-soon and Ha Myung-bok, Korea's leading abstract painters; and Bang Hyo-seong, known not only as a world-renowned performance artist, but also in Korea.

                explanation: "Schema Museum of Art is preparing for artist Seongmi Kim’s 12th solo exhibition ‘Afterimage of the Forest’ during this hot summer. ‘Forest’, which is the motif of the artist’s work, symbolizes ‘vitality and healing’ in life. The forest, which is both the home of human life and a resting place, serves as an inspiration from nature to the author. For artist Kim Seong-mi, ‘forest’ goes beyond a visual ‘forest’ and warns of the secrets and records it holds, and that humanity will inevitably destroy and become distant from nature as it develops into a new civilization and creates a new history. In this exhibition, various unexpected social and natural problems are presented through blue abstract flat work and video work. For the artist, the forest is a being that faces the external world as a life, and the yearning, longing, and regret for nature that the writer feels are related to the subtle world. The traces left as the colors are layered several times, the paint is absorbed, and it dries are the artist's expressions. We will present an abstract painting that shows the interaction of worldviews. In this exhibition, the artist has continued to use the forest as a motif in recent years to capture all the changes over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We hope that this will be an opportunity to find ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work.",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed depending on the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. How is the material world and the world of metaphysics related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence will this have on modern art? Also, modern art artists are still part of the material world in the generation that has the smoothest plane in human history. This exhibition was planned to examine how they exist and how they interact and work. Perhaps we understand the material particles symbolized by stones and the world of metaphysics and imagination derived from them in the most dense form? think. Artist Kim Yun-seop collects images from the flood of images, archives them day by day, and combines the contemporary art of the day on canvas to create the [Today's Contemporary Art Series]. He appropriates the images of modern art consumed through screens rather than materials to create new screen compositions and implements them in a pictorial way. Artist Byung-ho Lee is the only artist who works in three dimensions, and as a tool to create new sculptures, he first sketches using a 3D program. The sketched three-dimensional polygon is transferred back to the material, divided, and each part is reassembled and manufactured with different materials. He actively accepts the collisions and contrasts of materials that occur in this process and creates sculptures with new formative features. I think that author Cho Min-seon is the author who can most closely show the world of metaphysical imagination. Through his work, the author captures the ambivalence of humans who are interdependent but also constantly form relationships as independent entities. Various situations and complex emotions resulting from relationships are visualized using various media such as installation, video, and interactive. It is mainly shown as interactive installation work using technologies such as programming and video mapping, and also shows work incorporating photography or painting, and is also shown as a form of work that returns from data to material work. In this way, modern artists basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and produce their works again using the body represented by material. It is time to open our eyes to what significance this method has for us and how it will change in the future.",

                        text: "I mainly work by filling the screen with repetitive strokes or using the physical properties of oil paint to cover the entire screen with different layers. This way of working is performed not as a completion, but as an attempt to celebrate the drawing process and stay in it as much as possible. ‘Light Seekers’ appear in Ted Chiang’s short story ‘Hell is the Absence of God’. They are pilgrims who chase the light of heaven to enter heaven in the novel's worldview where the light descends. They may be injured or die during the pilgrimage, and may be blinded by the heavenly light they believe to be salvation or fall into hell. What is faith? In the eyes of reason, the Light Seekers are foolish gamblers, but they are existential in that they act even at the risk of their own death. I feel that there is no much difference between me, who continues to paint while anticipating failure, and the light seekers who pursue the heavenly light. But unlike me, Light Seekers do not doubt salvation. Through the belief that they can enter heaven by touching the light and the existential practice that follows, they may already be saved people who feel God and live this life in hope. I don't yet know the shape of my finished painting, but I always work as if I'm praying, aiming to reach it. It's not pessimistic. However, I try to stay in the drawing process as long as possible and try to delay that ecstatic moment of salvation, which may only happen once, as much as possible.",

Figures drawn in parts sequentially have their own flow of light and different viewpoints, so they are together but have different spatial characteristics, and they are contrasted with flat planes and three-dimensional surfaces, and planes and lines, creating a surreal composition that is connected together in the space of the painting. have it I believe that painting is the face that reflects our contemporary times.

The work presented before ‘Smooth Stone Field’ at the Schema Museum of Art is the ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series. The ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series is based on the methodology of Auguste Rodin, a sculptor from the late 19th century. Rodin enjoyed marcottage work, which involves recombining existing works and presenting them as new works, and in the process of this work, unused by-products were created, which Rodin called ‘abattis.’ The 'Eccentric Abattis' series allows us to accept (Rodin's) Abatti, which was left behind after its usefulness was exhausted, from a work object to a subject, and further subdivides the Abatti whose shape remains to the point where its shape has ambiguity, and then reuses it as a formative material. It is a series of combinations.",

This is visualized not only through video work, but also through various media installation methods using various objects and sensors. In this exhibition, the works <reflection, 2021> and <fragility, 2020> are combined into one to present a work with a new meaning. Specifically, it is the work of thinking about the various changing relationships in modern society and guiding the viewer into the work to form a new relationship between them and the work or to reinterpret it. Several beam projectors installed on the ceiling of the exhibition hall project toward the floor. Geometrically shaped fragments are constantly floating and change their appearance according to the data values ​​of the sensor. Additionally, there are broken pieces of mirror installed on the wall. A broken piece of mirror distorts and reflects light in space differently depending on the degree and direction of its surface. The three-dimensional and unrealistic effect created by dozens of mirror sculptures transports you to a utopian place that does not belong to any space and a Uchronian time that does not exist in reality. The mirror used as a medium is an intermediate device that reflects our appearance in reality while escaping the actualized space and inducing an experience in another dimension. Mirrors broken into different shapes trap viewers within small pieces and provide an opportunity to view themselves as different objects. And the fragmentary images reflected through the mirror constitute a dreamlike, neutral world that cannot be experienced in reality.",

It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store-type platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that expanded into the world. SM-Smash, the online metaverse branch of the Schema Museum of Art, is holding its second exhibition after <Data Meterial>, the first exhibition that tested the possibilities of digital media. The second exhibition, <Wa are Happening>, presents an experimental exhibition in the field of performance using the Metaverse platform. Audiences enter a new world of play through Decentraland, the world's largest metaverse platform. This type of exhibition, which involves visiting the SM-Smash box office located in Decentraland (57,-83) and entering Metaberry, a new metaverse space, is the first inter-metaverse mobile exhibition in Korea and an expansion of the metaverse platform. It shows the possibility of a new form of dramatic art through the possibility of and network. Director Song Joo-ho of Diorama Vivant Theater, who was invited for this exhibition, designs and experiments with expanded forms of plays based on his unique analog sensibility. The audience will pass through the box office and enter the theater to experience a new play that stands at the forefront of modern art.",

As they excavate the remains of characters who have already died and been buried in the ground, they reproduce the forgotten expressions and lost voices of the dead. – Description of work: <History / Hysterie> consists of two-dimensional videos of six actors imagining a “lost narrative” excavating remains or giving a monologue. In this work, the theme of ‘loss’ is externalized in the form of ‘footage’ referring to “lost data.” Between the way the fragmented and scattered footage is displayed in the Metaverse Theater and the way it is viewed, the audience, who have become performers and avatars, attempt to approach the “completed or already dead” original from their own perspective, the lost narrative. Various editions will be 'played' in . This landscape of restoration seeks to witness the kind of neurosis suffered as the history of a real work is transferred to the virtual world as an “avatar of the work.” History may also be a performance of neurosis. - Production intention: The impossibility of eternity, a characteristic of a play that cannot maintain a specific state between a one-time live performance and multiple reenactments, is itself a mythical act and a way of existence that resists “completion or death.” Although a play cannot reproduce death, it manages to reenact it, exploring or staying at the edge of the myth. Sometimes, when it wants to penetrate into the inside of the myth, it creates a narrative-story that it has never experienced, revealing its desire and being consumed by it. Perhaps because desire cannot reproduce death, it is better resisted through theater. Meanwhile, ‘Diorama Vibang Theater’ creates plays based on the aesthetic ethics of the irreverence of art called ‘incompleteness’, which is revealed in the characteristic of the impossibility of eternity in plays. The incompleteness referred to here does not refer to “an unfinished story,” but to “not resisting death.” Then, suddenly, I think of a play that can only be recreated by taking advantage of the characteristics of film, which can permanently fix the finished result.",

                explanation: "Artist Koo Ja-soong (1941~, Western painter) is a first-generation Korean hyperrealist artist who shows restrained still life paintings through the private space of an Eastern worldview. Artist Koo Ja-seung was born in 1941 and graduated from the Department of Painting and the Graduate School of Education at Hongik University College of Fine Arts. Starting with his first solo exhibition at Sun Gallery in 1978, he has been engaged in endless artistic activities for 44 years. Artist Jang Ji-won (1946~, Western painter) uses flowers, birds, and trees as a metaphor for nature hidden in his mind, and still creates his work through a fierce battle with himself to create his imaginary world. Artists Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won began working in Chungju in 1986 when they moved their studio to the banks of the Namhan River in Chungju. After retiring from Sangmyung University, artist Koo Ja-seung built his current studio in 2007 and continues to work in North Chungcheong Province. This exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won at the Schema Art Museum is an exhibition with a special synergy as they are a local senior artist and a married couple. It can be said that the two artists left a significant mark on the Korean art world as colleagues who communicated and stimulated each other. Although the painting styles of the two couples are different, the subject matter of their works, flowers, is something they have in common. In the fierce world of artists, the two couples have supported and supported each other for half their lives, building and expanding their own unique world of work with the beauty of new formative interpretations, the space of Eastern thought, and an Oriental perspective. Artist Koo Ja-seung paints still life paintings that are close to hyper-realism, and ordinary motifs such as glasses, liquor bottles, vases, flowers, and chests become the main characters of artist Koo Ja-seung's paintings. These objects harmonize with each encounter through their delicacy and light reflection effect, and rather than intentionally crowding many objects into the center of the canvas and reproducing or moving them, they show the restrained flow of time. In the artist's understated still life paintings, we can get a glimpse into the artist's intense mental world beyond beauty. Artist Jang Ji-won shows the hidden dimensions of nature through his own imaginative landscapes. Materials such as flowers, birds, and trees that appear in the artist's work are created using Korean paper as a basic work, repeatedly cutting and pasting, painting, scraping, and attaching Korean paper again to create the desired shape with a thick matiere effect, and acrylic, oil, and other materials such as flowers, birds, and trees appear in the artist's work. It is expressed freely using various materials such as pastel and colored pencil. The author looks into the essence of humans in nature and shows a world of healing and happiness, comfort and peace. This invitational couple exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won, held at the Schema Museum of Art, is an exhibition in which the 44-year-long world of works by Koo Ja-seung, a master of realism in North Chungcheong Province, and the 40-year-long world of artist Jang Ji-won's works face each other. The world of work by two senior couple artists who supported and communicated with each other for half their lives will be exhibited at the Schema Art Museum on October 14-11. You can enjoy it until the 13th. Through 'Breathing Still Life' by Koo Ja-seung, who maintains his unshakable position as the best artist of Korean realism, and 'Hidden 次元' by Jang Ji-won, who shows another world of still life painting that shows the imaginative landscape of nature with warm materials, This exhibition will explore the aesthetic formativeness and mental expression of previous realism and immerse yourself in the charm of original and beautiful still life paintings.",

I always search to find paintings that breathe and the finer breathing that the subjects provide. In my paintings, I heal those still lifes full of wounds, as if the object I'm drawing is not a large lump of inanimate object, but countless dream fragments that are broken, overcome the traces of the wreckage, and become a complete object.",

People will be able to enter the link for each space, and artists will be able to share ideas here and interact with artists from around the world within the metaverse. Our goal is to showcase the works of young Korean artists to the world through SM-Smash#3 space and to help them create their own metaverse studio spaces, making it an art street. By helping and exchanging information and creating metaverse studios for various Korean artists, I hope that this will become a place for information exchange similar to real estate. In addition, we plan to expand participation through publicity by creating various art experience events and giving people from all over the world the opportunity to experience Korean art.

The culture and arts education program created by the Shema Museum of Art, in collaboration with local artists, is different from general school education and strives to provide customized culture and arts education for people of various ages. This results report exhibition is a support project for the Dream Attic Saturday Culture School - 'Catching a Floating Cloud' with artist Shin Yong-jae, a representative local sky recorder, and 'Sculpture Pouch', a one-year children's culture and arts education project with Baek Sol-moe, an abstract sculpture artist. ' This is a results report exhibition that reports on the progress and process in the form of an archive and exhibition. I believe that the exhibition is a time when participants in all programs can once again think about the importance of social arts education and the role of art museums, and establish the Shema Art Museum as a public cultural space and a space for communication with citizens. We invite you to the cultural arts education results report exhibition, which was more lively than any other year and enabled participating families and children to feel their passion.",

                explanation: "The artists participating in the 2022 ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition are those who have just graduated or are new artists about to make a new start. The Schema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists and encourage the passion of new artists for their work in order to continuously establish a balance in local art every year. This exhibition supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition, and hopes to create new challenges and opportunities for local young artists and create an art ecosystem in our region. The ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition will be held in two parts, the ‘Unstable Possibilities 1’ exhibition will feature artists Ki-tae Kim, Byeol Son, Seung-won Yoon, Sang-hee Jeon, and Gyu-bong Choi, and the ‘Unstable Possibilities 2’ exhibition will feature artists Jun-hu Kim, Yu-seung Lee, Jun-woo Lee, Yun-hee Jang, and Chi-hoon Jeon. A total of ten artists participate. In particular, as Unstable Possibility implies, writers are unstable but contain infinite possibilities. Artists visualize unstable reason and their own perception of the world in a variety of ways, and express in their works everything from the stories of individuals living their daily lives to the world we live in and their thoughts about art. These thoughts and concerns are unstable, but they are creating a new world. Artist Kim Ki-tae, who is participating in the first exhibition of Unstable Possibilities, says he wants to find a life that flows naturally. I try to find such questions through ‘Cactus’. To the author, cacti provide comfort, but at the same time, the numerous thorns are also a personal pain and the pain and suffering experienced while searching for life.",

In that sense, every year, the Shema Museum participates in various international events planned, selects representative artists who have been most active internationally, and awards plaques and prize money.

He is very active not only in China but also around the world, including in the US, UK, and Korea, with drawings, objects, installations, and performances. His work 'Unity of Heaven and Man' performance, 'Northern Romanticism' production, 'Gihwaseungcho (奇花昇草)' objet installation work, and drawing series are all indicative of his genius as an artist. These works are sufficient to show the appearance of . After a chance meeting with Kim Jae-kwan, director of the Shema Art Museum, in 2009, he held the “不期而遇” exhibition <Beijing Amnesty Gallery, 2010>, “和異不同” exhibition <Cheongju Shema Art Museum, 2011>, and “Inherent and Unborn” exhibition <Beijing Amnesty Gallery, 2010>. We participated in several special exhibitions together, including Space Gallery, 2012, and exchanged between Beijing and Cheongju. In particular, he was selected as an artist representing China and participated in the four-country international exchange exhibition “Memory and Imagination as New Art,” held as a special exhibition at the Shema Art Museum in 2017. Cang The relationship between the two artists extends beyond their works and extends to a spiritual connection between them, and they are firmly maintaining their own identities. In this invitational exhibition, you can enjoy a total of 13 works by artist Chang Shin, ranging from his 2003 work to his performance video from 2020. Unfortunately, it is very unfortunate that author Chang Shin cannot attend this meaningful event due to the ‘COVID-19’ pandemic. However, we have hope and expectation that we will be able to meet again soon.",

New shamanism includes animism among shamanistic worship in cold regions, dualism of ancient Persian Zoroastrianism, Babylonian astrology, Hinduism's theory of reincarnation, compassion for animals among Indian Jainism, practice of arc-shaped circling among Islamic Sufis, Gnostic theism, and wisdom of Jewish Kabbalah. The spiritual practices of life at the time were explored, including trees, the I Ching numeral ruler, Taoist cultivation techniques, Western alchemy, the mystical teachings of Hermes, the Pythagorean school of numbers, and the “new era” spiritual training movement that emerged in the West after World War II. It is integrated. Science promotes contemporary humanity to develop nature and present cutting-edge theories and achievements through logical reasoning and empirical methods. For example, cyborgs, blockchain, Internet of Things, brain science, digital currency, algorithmic life, new media art, bio-genetic engineering, space travel, nanotechnology, quantum physics, human immortality, emergence of singularity, etc. are related to the philosophy of science religion and technology. In the background, traditional lifestyles and the appearance of the Earth are changing dramatically. In conclusion, we aim to subjectively build a systematic artistic language system through the two lines of “New Shamanism” and “Cutting-edge Achievements of Science.”",

                explanation: "Beyond Lotus: The Shema Museum of Art's first special invitation exhibition in 2021, 'Indrayala: Lotus' by artist Jaeboon Shim, features 64 'lotus' photographic works taken by the artist from 2018 to recent times. This is an exhibition presented. In modern art, photography goes beyond the basic properties of ‘recording and reproduction’ to enable individual expression, and the possibilities for expression are diversifying and expanding depending on how the artist selects and views the subject. By capturing 'lotus flowers' with his camera, artist Shim Jae-bun has expanded his realm of expression to the world of unconsciousness and imagination deep inside the artist, and has spent several years trying to find the inner expression of the object called 'lotus flower' rather than simply reproducing it. By recording it, it is leading to the practice of going into the spiritual world of enlightenment. The exhibition title, Indrjala, fully embodies the artist's thoughts. Indrjala is said to mean Indra's net in Sanskrit. According to ancient Indian mythology, it covers the sky above the Foresight City, where the god Indra lives, and is said to be a kind of weapon, with precious beads embedded in each net, and the lights coming from it overlap countless times, creating a mysterious world. In Buddhism, it is used to mean the world of dharma that is constantly connected to each other and spreads throughout the world, and Indramang is also a Buddhist perspective on the world. In the ‘Indriyala: Lotus’ exhibition, artist Shim Jae-bun goes beyond the subject of ‘lotus’ and looks at the human world through the artist’s own Indra network. Although we seem to live alone, in reality we are connected to each other, and we use 'ultra-telephoto lenses' and 'ultra-wide-angle lenses' to recreate our existence in a close relationship where we reflect on each other and further extend to relationships with the world and humans. By using this, the surreal reality felt by capturing the nature that the eye cannot see in a single image is turned into a work of art and another image is reproduced. In this exhibition, he penetrated the essence of the object and recreated it in his own language, including 'primitive innocence', 'purification of purity', 'shadow of existence', 'corruption of obsession', 'shape of haggard agony', and 'balance and shape'. The exhibition will feature works from the series ‘In Search’ and ‘Sublimation of the Free Spirit’ as well as the installation work ‘Chaos’.",

When I see lotus flowers, my thoughts go not only to the record of their name, but also to the small sound they make as they are shaken by the wind. Lotus flowers grown by water, air, wind, and soil... It is a universal idea that combines the underworld, earth, and sky, symbolizing fertility as the source of life, and sought to find the link between rebirth in paradise, reincarnation, and fate in the four seasons of the lotus. Whether it is a dark night or a foggy lotus field, with persistent vitality and wisdom, it is not stained by dirt even in dirty mud, is not bewitched even when rising above the shaking water, and blooms and bears fruit at the same time, showing cause and effect at the same time and creating a cause. He was already telling the truth that the results were also there. By taking as the photographic subject another link of an inherent relationship that could not be felt in its actual form, the process is direct and abstract, indirect, indirect and implicit, changing, adding or removing saturation or light color from the visible reality. I tried to prevent the sublimation of a free spirit by looking into the starting point of the relationship. I was able to get a little closer to the truth that not everything that is visible is everything, but even everything that is invisible is the truth.",

The Shema Museum of Art is attempting to replace the studio as a place that combines the inside and outside of the Shema Museum with an art museum. Schema Art Museum, located in the beautiful countryside of Naesu, Cheongju, is a venue equipped with both an outdoor space and a white cube, and is offering a studio-exhibition space to five artists. Artists feel inspiration for their works from inside or outside, on the walls or outdoors, and proceed with their work here. This is an extension and replacement of the artist's personal ‘studio’, with the purpose of producing new works while feeling a different sense of place, and vividly recording and turning the site into a work of art. The 'STUDIO' exhibition is a place where artists produce, think, and move their work in Cheongju by providing a studio-exhibition hall at the Schema Art Museum, a place with both an outdoor space and a white cube located in the beautiful countryside of Naesu, Cheongju. We would like to feel the inspiration for the works of five artists inside and outside the Shema Museum, on the walls or outdoors, and proceed with their work here. The participating artists are five artists active in the Cheongju area: Hyunmook Kim, Nile Creven, Shin Yongjae, Seongu Lee, and Jaeyoung Choi. They serve as a medium connecting the inside and outside of the Schema Museum of Art, and the artists use the Schema Museum as a place and studio where new works are created. Additionally, this is an exhibition that is occupied by the works created here. In particular, the five artists participating in this exhibition seek to communicate through contemporary discourse and multifaceted visual formative works by exploring the passion for their work, fresh ideas, their infinite potential, experiments and challenges that can be developed in the future, and the identity of their work. do. This ‘studio’ exhibition, planned by the Schema Museum of Art, seeks to become a medium for questioning the sense of place and serving as an experimental creative space in the expanding contemporary art. In modern art, ‘place’ has given us many meanings and given us new inspiration, and it is still ongoing. In the ‘studio’ exhibition, the image of a place is its identity, and is created individually, collectively, and socially. This exhibition, featuring young local artists Hyun-mook Kim, Nile Creven, Shin Yong-jae, Seon-gu Lee, and Jae-young Choi, who are creating and searching for their own 'identity', is an organic relationship between White Cube and the outside world by giving the artists a new space called the Schema Art Museum. This is an exhibition in which the artists encounter different memories and inspirations in an environment that is embodied in various media, including paintings and installations. Artists explore their passion for work, fresh ideas, their infinite potential, experiments and challenges that can develop in the future, and the identity of their work. Contemporary discourse and the exhibition of multifaceted visual formative works lay a new foundation for local contemporary art. I expect that it will be done.",

Recently, I have been drawing works about the impact of the surrounding environment on people at a sensory and emotional level. We plan to continue this exploration next year. The most recent works deal with much more personal topics. I draw inspiration from my body and environment to create works that reveal my own insecurities, obsessions and moods. The studio is a safe place where you can freely explore personal topics. Taking work out of the studio and exhibiting it is an act based on trust. Because I create and exhibit more personal work, the act of exhibiting has a deeper meaning. What I want to explore in this exhibition is the entire process of bringing work out of the studio for the artist and the audience. The works that remain in the studio can be considered failures. Or maybe it's something so personal that you don't want to display it. However, among my works, these works may leave a stronger impression than the works I usually display to show to others. Past work often did not deal with personal topics, but rather attempted to take a more universal approach to the subject. In the future, I plan to try to give more personal and personal meaning to my work.",

He examines with his eyes the image of a space that seems far from reality, and changes that are not static are expressed through feelings that occur in the moment. The color of the sky changes all the time, and the shapes of the clouds are also irregular. An unpredictable attitude brings tension, comfort, and excitement. People have lived together with nature, but their roles seem to be different. The appearances and feelings of nature are different at every moment, and the colors cannot be the same even when drawn. Changes that never stop make us feel the passage of time. The more you focus on looking at the sky, the calmer it becomes. The noises of life subside to the point where you can't believe your ears, and only the temperature, smells, the strength of the wind, and the sounds of nature embrace your body. At these moments, like a scene you may have seen in a movie or drama, you stand still and the surroundings keep changing. When you look at it, the time given by nature is sometimes slow and sometimes fast. When drawing while looking at the sky, natural brush strokes are created through unclear thoughts conveyed through the senses of the body rather than through precise shapes. Leave the brush strokes to your senses. My mood is controlled by these things and I feel like I am being absorbed into what I am looking at. As I looked at the dawn, the energy of morning, the glare at noon, the silent change at sunset, and the night when the light disappeared, I saw days that were neither regular nor the same. Compared to people, each day repeats itself, but today and tomorrow are different lives. Each day is set in time, but this is also based on the flow of nature, and each person has small changes in the day. That's how each day passes by. It seems that as such days accumulate, a person's life is created and the valuable word 'lived' is used. I feel like living means continuing to walk through that endless, empty space. On a day without a single cloud, a corner of my heart feels depressed when I look at that endless place. Just as memories deteriorate and become dull over time, the act of continuing to look at the sky and draw is a natural part of one's daily routine. It's raining. What you sense are a cloudy sky, generally dark light, a damp coolness, and the sound of rain. The feelings that arise in this atmosphere give rise to emotions. There are times when it becomes unpleasant or depressing, but there are also times when it is charming. The parts where I paint in the rain are different movements from the paintings I did before. I have unexpected fun when those marks on the canvas become tangled or erased by rainwater. The state in which emotions arise on a rainy day is like seeing changes while drawing. I have no choice but to accept the falling rain. I saw the sky by chance every day. There must have been emotional turmoil in painting the sky. The feeling that it was beautiful and that it was no different came from seeing the coincidental appearance of the sky. Rather than wondering how they came into being, I compared the emotions that I empathize with based on everyday life to the sky. And when I engage in the act of drawing, I feel the freedom of escaping from the hustle and bustle of life.",

However, behind this place of tranquility, there is an implicit condition, ‘within space’, as if it were a betrayal. Some people think that these trading conditions are natural. However, on the contrary, it may be that we have become insensitive due to the numerous senses repeated over a long period of time, or that 'tranquility' represents the standardized social frame created within the category of 'rational' from the hunting era through the modernist era to modern society. I wonder if it was packaged in packaging and was continuously having an impact. Perhaps the current space appears to me as a beautifully packaged heterotopia. There are several situations that underlie this idea. The first is the 'anxiety' that appears in the social position of the artist as the head of the household. Of course, physical space and 'anxiety' feel like disparate things, but many people use the term 'home' to recognize space as a place to relieve 'anxiety'. However, it can be said that the starting point of the artist's work was that he did not feel that the place called 'home' was a place to resolve 'anxiety'. And secondly, there is habit. When a writer is involved in a certain location, I always start researching that place as a habit. Everything that makes up the place is checked, from the overall structure of the place in large detail to the number of windows, the structure of the ceiling and roof, the beams of the walls, and the materials. I don't know when this habit started, but it seems like it's been around for a long time. Let's look at the spaces that come into contact with me due to the complex effects of these situations. And the result of the experiment using all the elements that appear in that space is my work.",

                explanation: "Cho Hyun-ae Painting: Construction of space and time in the virtual world: How are new thoughts created? For artists who have to conceive of a new work, go through the working process, and complete the work, they never stop worrying about new thoughts and work, because the blank canvas is another world facing the real world. Therefore, conceptual artist Lee Woo-hwan defined the moment a brushstroke is made on a white canvas as the moment when the real world and another world meet for the first time. Perhaps because such philosophical ideas are the basis, most of the titles of artist Lee Uhwan's works are ‘meeting’ or ‘encounter.’ In the book <Space Created by Space>, architect Yoo Hyeon-jun says, “Empty space exists before light. “On the dark earth God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” There is a phrase that says. In the English Bible, ‘empty’ is written as ‘Void.’ In the early days of civilized society, when there was little scientific thinking, it was thought that when God created the world, he first created ‘empty space’, ‘void space’, and then ‘light’. This means that even light cannot exist without empty space. Einstein, a genius physicist, does not recognize ‘empty space’ in the ‘principle of relativity’ he discovered. The reason is that he defined ‘empty space’ (air) as a substance. Likewise, in modern art, Picasso's 'Cubism' deconstructed perspective, rejected naturalistic light and shade, and eliminated illusionary space, so there is no empty space in Cubist works. This is what the author said about the work at the Grimson Gallery solo exhibition in 2015. First, the author must have his or her own creative image. Second, the content of the picture does not necessarily have to be descriptive. It must be able to trigger imagination, whether it is non-objective, non-representational, or non-representational. Third, it must be metaphorical. A metaphor in a work must have a connection, whether verbal or visual. These three characteristics still apply equally today. In the end, we can see that Cho Hyun-ae's new paintings use new materials while recovering images from flat paintings that were premised on the dissolution of images, and her interest changed to the problem of composing and expressing new spaces and times. Visual metaphors are created on a two-dimensional plane and associations contained within the metaphors are created. Since the images that appear here are simultaneously reproduced in screen space across time, they can be described as a feature of 'composition of space and time'. same. Characteristics of post-postmodernism include the most complex style with a pluralistic structure, accepting sensibility as an important expressiveness. The characteristics of the complex style of the pluralistic structure try to match the ideas, situations, and experiences described by analogy, metaphor, symbol, and allegory. This emerges from the recognition of new meanings and values, expressing ecological sensibility, paying attention to future problems, breaking away from Modernist's dry style, and transitioning to a free method. I think that these elements, whether it is the problem of ‘empty space’ or the problem of ‘sensibility’, act as major elements that form Cho Hyun-ae’s work. Paul Klee said, “Art is not a reproduction of what is visible; it is a means of making visible what is invisible.” Ultimately, as Klee said, painting is about reproducing the invisible world. And it is clear that the reproduced image is ‘not’ real, no matter how identical it is. Cho Hyun-ae’s world of work brings to mind ‘René Magritte’ and ‘Chagall’ as exemplary artists. In terms of representation, Chagall's world of work is surrealistic, an exploration of the existence and reality of objects, a problem of the visible and the invisible, a problem of reality and illusion, that is, a problem of vision and perception. Magritte's world of work can be defined as a matter of 'words and images'. ‘Words and images’ can replace words in description, and sometimes they can accurately refer to names written in paintings, or they can be ambiguous, and in some cases, they can have an ironic metaphor. For this reason, Magritte is evaluated as the artist who first presented the issues of ‘image’, ‘water’, and ‘language’ in painting. A characteristic of Cho Hyun-ae’s work is that she first establishes an ‘empty space’ on the screen in which to place an image. Next, like Magritte, he seems to be thinking about how to compose ‘image’, ‘water’, and ‘language’. It can be seen that interest is changing from the two-dimensional paintings that most of the works until recently were based on the premise of the deconstruction of the image to the problem of merging new materials and composing new space and time while recovering the image. By not only creating visual metaphors on a two-dimensional plane and creating associations contained in metaphors, but also merging 'objects', 'images', 'water', and 'language' are simultaneously reproduced in screen space beyond time, creating a new world. I think it can be explained by the characteristic of ‘composition of space and time’. As art historian Kit White said, “Images are abstract.” And “the image does not mean that it is the object that appears there. It is a conceptual or mechanical copy of an ‘object’ that was there before. It may seem obvious, but it is deeply related to the way we perceive ‘things’ and our attitude when using images. Since a painting is a symbolic convergence of various forms, it is always a ‘Metaphor’ whether it is conscious or not. It is the media of the symbolic language called metaphor, and it is the language of art.” Until about 10 years ago, Cho Hyun-ae's paintings remained in the category of modernist abstract art, but with her understanding of the flat surface and recognition of 'empty space', we can see that she has completely transformed into a new work after postmodernism. The 2015 Grimson Gallery solo exhibition and the 2020 Geumbosung Art Museum solo exhibition show continuous change and development. In particular, recent works are expected to expand in a more free way by spreading interest not only in the issues of space and time created by the combination of images and objects, but also in the expression of ecological sensibilities, which are increasingly important in contemporary art, and future issues. do.",

                        text: "The theme of my work is time. Just as life is a world of aporia with a distant horizon, time, the basis of life, is also distant. So time is not a simple flow or disappearance. Time is a place where the scenes of a long life are melted together. All memories, traces, dreams and expectations are lined up in layers. Time is thick. How do we measure the thickness of this time? My painting is a work of constructing space and time to create a visual metaphor on a two-dimensional plane and to express the associations contained in the metaphor in spatial and visual language. In the ambiguous boundary between reality and virtuality, the picture is completed by reproducing or transforming illusory images of the past, present, and future. The images that appear in the work maximize a surreal space that transcends time and space by arranging objects that existed in completely different spaces and times simultaneously or unrealistically, and also act as a metaphor for infinite space. Among the works of the last 2-3 years, there are works whose subject matter is a single large flower petal. The studio and surrounding environment have a great influence on the artist. Fortunately, my studio is located in the countryside, so I can come into close contact with all kinds of trees and flowers and really feel the change of seasons. Every year, one day, when I was captivated by the large and splendid appearance of the white peony flower, I waited for it to bloom all winter, and when I saw it wither and fall less than ten days after it bloomed, I felt sad and set one petal as a metaphor for time. It is also an expression of the loneliness that our lives are no different from our own lives as they bloom too briefly and then wither compared to the wait. In the first half of this year, I started a new work using wrapping cloth and shopping bags as a metaphor for time. In order to add a three-dimensional effect that was lacking in flat work, I created a shape canvas with birch wood and combined objects and neon to pursue layers of time in various ways. Shopping bags and wrapping cloths also have the symbolism of present and gift, so aren't they signifiers of love and desire that span the ages? Therefore, my work consists of a space with no boundaries between reality and virtuality, encompassing the past, present, and future, and an ambiguous flow of time between the past, present, and future.",

The number of symptomatic patients in the country is increasing, and news from outside the country is also worrying. Most stores in town are closed and people are cautious about their movements. The once vibrant market is depressed by doubt and anxiety. Meanwhile, spring has come. As the busy world comes to a halt, the wind and air are clean and the sunlight is brilliant. Driven by desire, I finally became interested in my village and looked at it more closely. Eumseong-eup is a small, clean village surrounded by soft mountains on all sides and Sujeongcheon Stream flowing in the center of the city. The thick and cultivated Mt. Gaseop blocks the cold winds from the north, so Yongsan-ri, at the foot of the southern mountain, is filled with warm sunlight. The terrain is good for fruit farming, so the entire area is full of peach fields. Fruit trees planted at regular intervals spread out on the hill, and flower trees in full bloom swelled as if they were about to explode. The spring breeze blows the branches of the flower trees and the birds are also noisy. I visited the area several times to observe the shape and size of trees and measure flowering times. I decided to match it with the peach blossoms that open spring. I decided to dye a thin, long piece of fabric, make clothes with the same color, and wear it to become a giant flower. I sat under a tree full of peach blossoms and slowly opened the petals along with the flowers from dawn to midday. The flowers did not fully bloom until midday. However, the current situation dominated by Corona is unstable, like a work of art made by mistake by an inexperienced craftsman. I don't know when this will end. I wanted to find comfort and strength in a more complete place. I tried to fit myself into the cycle of nature and match the energy of spring through Permanence, ‘I Am Here Now 5, At Yongsan-ri Orchard’.",

                        text: "In Greek mythology, Narcissus kept looking at his own reflection in water—the ancients used this fluid, mutable element to symbolize the temporary and illusory nature of the material universe—and tried to hold on to the reflection, but ended up losing himself. Just as humans lost their lives, humans continue to look into the mirror of nature (the “material universe”) and see themselves as the reflection they see, a body without intelligence (senseless clay). Narcissus's dream, which is accepted as his true self and ultimately unable to use his physical life as an opportunity to develop his invisible, immortal self, is expressed through the metaphor of a forest - Narcissus' fantastic dreams and self that are constantly reminded in reality. The dream of centralism expresses dense trees and disappearing into a lake or forest as if passing by.",

The image of the darkness with the moon floating on it and the moment below it overlapping and playing over and over again permeates the screen as a single scene.

It will be seen by you.” (Revelation 4:1) As I read the Book of Revelation, written by Apostle John while he was imprisoned on the island of Patmos, I wanted to picture a scene with an open door in heaven. The Bible depicts a scene in which a door opens in heaven and the throne of God unfolds. I also pictured two people floating up to see an open door in a blue sky with clouds, something I see every day. <Our Song>, 73 (Psalm 103:5) We read David's poem and reinterpreted it in light of our modern lives. Even though what we had hoped for did not turn out as we had hoped, we expressed our feelings by being satisfied with what was already good and continuing to sing.",

The work called <mowing> began because I was interested in the way the states before and after the grass was cleaned coexisted at the boundary during the mowing process. We also wanted to visually express the harmony of three dimensions, planes, and lines seen within it. The <fitting in> series is reminiscent of a scene where a leaf-shaped piece of grass lands and sits on an empty spot in the grass. As the title shows, I wanted to convey that every living thing has a given place that needs it. In other words, they are beings that are organically connected to each other.",

This is an idea about existence, and is deeply connected to relative time and memory. I often use bleeding and polling techniques because of the beauty, physicality, and action of the phenomenon. My paintings are like a ‘relationship that returns sensations, movements, and actions’ created between viewers, or a ‘neutral place’ that elicits a certain answer. I am trying to create a shared experience of encountering the unseen.",

What I express with color and shape is every moment and every moment, and these are ‘interlaced scenes.’ The world has recently become more connected virtually through the internet and social media platforms. These sites are overloaded with too much spontaneous content for users and don't give us enough time to check what we're consuming. Unable to connect in this impersonal way, I find myself more alone than ever. My works are the pinnacle of myself, expressed through countless layers of shade on countless canvases, and the unexpected ‘scenes’ revealed through these works. These characteristics are constantly mixed and reorganized, ultimately creating other abstract ‘scenes’ of mine. Wherever we are, our skies are connected. As I look to the sky, I seek human connection with others through the nature around me. At that time, I realized that my ‘scene’ was right where I was. The world changed dramatically in 2020. I knew I was more alone than ever before. Our interactions moved online, and we spent a lot of time staring at various machine screens. We are overwhelmed by an absurd amount of information everywhere, both true and fake. I was not conscious of the ‘scene’, hesitated in my studio, and put down my brush. Instead, I revisited ‘scenes’ from the past, virtually. On an online map, I tracked where I had been, the cities and countries I visited, the places my friends and I gathered, and the ‘scenes’ in which I lived. I traveled all over the map to remember where my ‘scenes’ were. Feelings of air, sky, seasonal changes, and ‘scenes’ of various places are realized through colors and shapes without clear exposure to specific places or times. In the winter of 2020, I finally regained the strength and will to pick up a brush again. My works are often conceived in small towns rather than cities or tourist destinations. What allows me to create again is specifically the desire to recreate this place on canvas. These shapes were formed using a map of the location as a guide. The colors were created from inspiration and memories of the place. Instead of tracing an actual map, these shapes and colors were drawn simply and freely on a canvas. This ‘Academy Street’ is the same scene I encountered every day when I attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany. What I was there at that time became a layer of color and shape to be added to my ‘scenes’ later.",

She was afraid of revealing her inner self and intentions to others, and naturally learned a skill called ‘hypocrisy’ to communicate well. He was in the conflict of having to ignore the suspicion of ‘hypocrisy’ that made him ambiguous and accept it as a necessary evil. This work constructs ‘pachinko’ as a symbol of human essential desire and expresses human ‘hypocritical behavior’.

Therefore, the “constancy of size” and “perception of color” felt through vision vary greatly. I am interested in the discrepancy and uncertainty of such people's perspectives, and I create a 'retinal vision' by deconstructing and reconstructing spatial composition and color hierarchies around 'perspective' and 'light,' which are the eternal themes of painting. We are seeking a space where “vision” and “perceptual vision” can become one. Due to the ambiguity of the boundary, I tried to express ourselves wandering and enjoying ourselves between virtual and real, subject and object. The dog that creates an optical illusion on the screen blurs the boundary between virtuality and reality, and expresses the appearance of a dog, the most familiar of humans and other animals, to make us feel different from ourselves and at the same time feel homogeneous.",

                        text: "This exhibition’s photo series ‘Chandelier’ “Thread” has been the main theme of her plastic works so far, but the “Chandelier” series is a photographic work that captures countless thin threads of all colors tangled in the dark. The skeins of silk thread from Korea and Japan were first unraveled and then tangled and twisted again. It reminds me of the discrimination I experienced in Japan after the war, as I was born and raised in Daejeon before the war and returned home after the war. It is a tangle of memories that cannot be easily resolved by people who lived their lives without being able to say that they were born in the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese people interviewed, with an average age of 80, must have been torn and torn between the national framework of “homeland” where they were born and raised and “Japan (people)” for 70 years. Also, looking at the colorful splendor of the intertwined “bundle of threads,” it reminds me of the intersection of the life trajectories of countless people who moved to, came to, and left the city of Daejeon. It is a metaphor for the complicated and entangled history of the two countries, and considering that Daejeon was a city created as a base for railroad construction, it also appears to be a desire swelled like an aneurysm of a railroad expanding along with the desire for imperialism. Where personal memory, national desire, and the multi-layered meanings and metaphors of micro/macro overlap and refuse to determine a narrow, univocal meaning, there is the potential for the “Chandelier” series to be attractive as a work of art. – Megumi Takashima (excerpt from the critique)",

As a material, paint is made up of pigment and adhesive, and past tempera paintings also completed the surface by adhering the paint to the screen. When everyday materials such as paper, cardboard, or cloth are composed on screen, expressions and rhythms that are completely different from before are created. Going beyond painting techniques, we are pursuing the possibility of “adhesion” in various senses of modern art more broadly.",

In doing so, she attempts to reconstruct concepts about the objects using only letters extracted from the words they contain. This series of works of art appeared in 2008 and has since expanded to name a variety of colors and shades thanks to the rich vocabulary of the Japanese language. Traditional Japanese color names tell us not only about where the raw materials come from, but also about Japan's art history. The color itself has its own history. In other words, it is the history of how color is connected to society, culture, and art. For artists, the names of colors also have meaning, because they symbolize the craft knowledge of human society. Because the names of colors are deeply rooted in their respective origins and uses, Nagashima feels that they are an essential element of artistic practice. Although Nagashima only used Japanese characters and Kanji when her Word-Graphy project began, she now uses a variety of languages. Her latest work is a series of portraits of people she meets by chance during her travels, and she uses the language of the people she met. Every country has its own color names and a history and culture based on traditional color names. She aims to demonstrate global diversity.",

                explanation: "This exhibition is organized by ‘Aspect Contemporary Art Association’, the most representative art group leading contemporary art in the Cheongju region. ‘Aspect’, a leading contemporary art group in Cheongju, was founded in 1988 by Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art, as its first president, and celebrates its 33rd anniversary this year. From 2000, the group name was changed to ‘Late Aspect’, making a developmental change to adapt to the postmodern era. And through exhibitions, seminars, and symposiums, it has served as a driving force to further accelerate the creativity of artists. Meanwhile, Chungcheongbuk-do's first international exchange exhibition, Aspect Coterie, began in 1991 with the “Korea-Japan New Generation Artists Exhibition” at the Seibu Museum of Art in Funabashi, Japan, and continued for 15 years with a second exhibition at the Cheongju National Museum the following year. Afterwards, exchange exhibitions between Cheongju and Tokyo, Funabashi, and Chiba continued, serving as a motif for the rapid development of Cheongju's contemporary art. In addition, Aspect established the ‘Chungbuk Youth Art Award’ and held it 10 times so far, focusing on nurturing young artists. The spirit of Aspect is a club composed of professional writers who pursue a creative spirit, transcending all differences in school, regionalism, and generation. How will this exhibition view and interpret future changes while overcoming the coronavirus pandemic? How will we respond to a changing future? This is a themed exhibition. In this exhibition, 12 artists including Jaegwan Kim, Youngran Kim, Eunsoo Lim, Jinmyeong Park, Baeksun Jang, Seongmi Kim, Kyunghwa Lee, Seungeon Oh, Ingyu Choi, Mingeon Choi, Jaebun Shim, and Roy Kim, who are members of the Later Aspects Contemporary Art Club, participate.",

                        text: "Artist Jaikwan Kim's geometry is not a visible entity, but an abstract entity. The world of work, which started with grids and cubes, has gone through several stages of change and has recently expanded into the beauty of ‘distorted geometry’ and ‘multiple geometry’. The world of squares, which was the icon of the artist's abstract world, is deconstructed and freely expressed through new forms of 'rhythm' and 'color' of a more free geometric abstract world.",

                explanation: "The theme of the 2021 Cheongju Craft Biennale is “Tools for Conviviality.” It is said that this word was borrowed from Ivan Ilich's book <Tools of Autonomous Symbiosis>. The meaning of this year's theme is further explained as follows. “In an industrial society that has reached an irrecoverable state due to rapid growth over the past 200 years, individuals enjoy material abundance but have lost the confidence to overcome internal and external challenges, experiencing ‘modernized poverty’ and living in a standardized form of life. “We have been reduced to consumers of standardized products.” The Cheongju Craft Biennale mentions that it is a time when it is necessary to reflect on how contemporary crafts can deliver messages of healing and hope to people in a rapidly changed society amidst materialism, globalization, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In this way, the Cheongju Craft Biennale is conducting the biennale while thinking about how to create ‘tools for symbiosis’ for a ‘symbiotic society’ in the 21st century. In modern art, crafts and paintings show delicate differences in that they pursue the same and conflicting points. Paul Klee, a Spanish painter in the early 20th century, said, “Art is not a reproduction of the visible, but a making visible of the invisible.” He also said, “It is not that humans perceive color, but that color shakes the human heart.” If crafts started from use, painting started from emotional concepts, so they have very conflicting aesthetic values. As mentioned in the ‘Eco-Biennale Special Exhibition’ in 2013, the Korean Contemporary Art Contemporary Exhibition shows that the artists invited to this exhibition are senior artists in the Korean art world who are now following in the footsteps of artists in their 80s. Therefore, the same generation group is evaluated as a true elite group equipped with ‘inner reason’ at a turning point in Korean contemporary art. Therefore, I believe that the art historical evaluation of these generations will be subject to reevaluation and will become more important from now on. Twelve contemporary artists, including the late artists Lee Doo-sik, Hwang Chang-bae, and Kim Young-bae, as well as Kim Ryeong, Kim Jae-gwan, Kim Tae-ho, Shin Mun-yong, Ryu In-su, Jeon Yeon-il, Han Ki-ju, Han Man-young, and Hong Jae-yeon, have crossed the eight ridges of the Korean art world and reached the top. It can be said to be a valuable asset. Perhaps some artists have already reached the pinnacle of Korean painting. The “Special Exhibition of the Half Century of Korean Contemporary Art” held in conjunction with the “Art Bridge” project of the 12th Cheongju Craft Biennale Museum can be said to be a very valuable exhibition that enriches the autumn flower garden in Cheongju.",

                        text: "“I think art is a product of more human frustration.” He also said, “I believe that faith, skepticism, and humility can only be learned through the existence and experience of a difficult life. “Art is not only about what is visible in this world, but it also draws out the illusions in our thoughts, creates new images, and gives birth to ‘life’ with philosophical principles and concepts.” I want to say this. Geometry is not a visible entity, but an abstract entity. My world of work, which started with grids and cubes, has gone through several stages of change and has recently expanded into the beauty of ‘distorted geometry’ and ‘multiple geometry’. I want to dismantle the world of squares, which was the icon of my abstract world, and freely express myself with new forms of ‘rhythm’ and ‘color’ of a more free geometric abstract world. My world of work, which had evolved from the ‘Relationship Series’ era to the ‘Cube Series’ era since the late 70s, has changed again from the ‘Cube Series’ to the ‘Late Relationship Series’ since 2020. I would like to say that the meaning is not a return to the past, but the rediscovery of concepts and methods that were not completed in the past and the beginning of a new search. ※ The art of returning to nature is ‘necessarily’ aesthetic and formative. I start to think that it is not drawn according to principles and principles. I think that it is created by weaving the patterns of life in my mind with warp and weft, and I am putting 'light' into that space.",

However, the message in the work does not say that life, like flowers, is fleeting. Life is a concentric circle, made up of small grains of emotion. Therefore, it is expressed as each bead. Life is originally made up of elementary particles, and it contains the paradoxical meaning that it is nothing more than a small particle in the universe. The beginning of life, we wait with excitement. And flowering. Donga, a flower that blooms, experiences emotions such as inner pain, joy that can be healed, and shining hope at the same time. Additionally, flowers foretell fruition. The fruit abandons itself again and gains another life through sharing. If there is no pain and suffering, there is no inherent desire energy. The inner voice is always directed towards beauty and hope.",

Since the mid-1980s, pieces of panel have been connected, and the work consists of a support called a panel (meaning a flat surface that serves as the basis for a picture, such as a canvas), a shape image contained therein, and a geometric pattern. And while most writers read things intuitively, we discover that the characteristics of his work come from his cross-sighted behavior of trying to twist things. It is the most important element in creating his art and is realized through a technique in which shape images and pattern images are inverted on the screen. Not only has he been using shape canvas (transformable canvas) since the 1980s, he has been borrowing comics as a form of his paintings, and as he has become able to freely use computers, he has been able to freely transform pictorial structures and images through high-tech media. The function was also utilized. Artist Kim Young-bae expresses the daily life of our time through images and symbols. The woman in the work “Untitled” also has large gray spots that seem to be vaguely floating in the air, and an explosion image that seems to explode social anger and the confusing contradictions of modern society, forming a strange composition. Artist Kim Young-bae is a brilliant pop artist of our time who was the first Korean artist to bring everything trapped in popular culture into modern art, but he is another unfortunate artist who passed away just before he reached stardom.",

A paradoxical method is devised by partially scraping off the layers of color built up in this way. As he said, this method is nothing but “a structure of paradox revealed through erasure.” Because many colors have been built up, when you cut away a part with a chisel, the color dots hidden in the paint layer come back to life clearly. Like the breath of life, it acts as a subtle rhythm. In contrast to the solid outer structure, the delicate inner rhythm creates a mysterious dimension of creation. It could be said that there has been a transition from the initial duality of representation to the duality of method.",

In terms of color, primary colors such as red, blue, green, and yellow are mainly used instead of the dark and gloomy tones that were mainly used by artists of previous eras. The juxtaposition of brilliant primary colors that stand out in my work has its origins in the composition of the colors (five colors) of Buddhist paintings or Dancheong, and although I use Western formative language, its roots can be said to lie in our Eastern spirit. Intense primary colors with high saturation can be seen as a revival of traditional colors. Black lines that move sometimes quickly and powerfully, sometimes slowly, or in a rhythmic manner are also oriental. This aspect is further emphasized by using diluted acrylic and oriental painting brushes. The white background suggests rays of light radiating from behind or infinite space, which is in line with the concept of blank space in oriental painting, which is understood as a reflection of the spirit, and the method of drawing by controlling strength and breathing is itself based on oriental painting as the source of the idea. . While creating this piece for this feast day, I created it while thinking about our beautiful and extravagant feast day, which is different from Western parties.",

                        text: "The fundamental questions that dominate the world of Han Man-young’s work are “time” and “space.” This question becomes concrete by replicating time and exploring the origins of space. To use a metaphor, he is similar to a philosopher or anthropologist searching for the “origin of the world.” So how are these questions reproduced? It is by assemblage. The assemblage that encompasses his world of work reflects the modern system of thought. This is because, unlike the world as a whole or a theological worldview, it can be interpreted as a metaphor for modernity built from a combination of heterogeneous fragments. Meanwhile, Han Man-young's assemblage is a device that reveals the artist's spirit and attitude more than anything because it inscribes time in space and arranges or expands traces of time in space. Here, assemblage should be viewed as a philosophical exploration that goes beyond formative methodology. Looking at the <Origin of Space> series, the illusion of perspective is intentionally eliminated, but one can get a glimpse of the artist's will to present an ‘instance of space’ by intervening another screen or three-dimensional space within one screen. This attempt to overcome the limitations of the flat surface becomes more active by utilizing the three-dimensionality of the box. If you look closely, you will see that by attaching a mirror to the inner side of the box, the reflected space that the painting indicates extends to the surface, which seems to overturn the order of Renaissance perspective. In contrast, the <Reproduction of Time> series is mainly composed of a combination of images extracted from Eastern and Western art history and everyday objects. These include ancient artifacts, Marillil Monroe and Hwang Shin-hye, wire, clock parts, and old televisions. In this way, the use of typical images/objects representing Eastern and Western art history and civilization is often compared to Duchamp's readymades and Warhol's pop art. Additionally, the way objects are used is reminiscent of French Nouveau Realism. It is said that the Nouveau Realists at the time witnessed a social phenomenon of coveting ‘wealth’ itself beyond material convenience through the products of civilization. So, while the Nouveau Realists inferred the relationship between matter and spirit in the context of capitalism, Han Man-young's objects should rather be seen as surrealist devices that mediate experience and memory. Assemblage, which recombines symbols extracted from different times, histories, and places, can be interpreted as an attempt to vividly reproduce an ambiguous reality rather than a combination of meanings. In the end, the surreal here is closer to the dépaysement effect that makes reality unfamiliar rather than an ideology.",

                        text: "The spirit sews paintings and prints. ‘Post-truth’ writer Jaeyeon Hong sometimes separates life and art and seeks art through her attitude toward life. The world in which he consistently worked was abstract. His paintings and prints are even eclectic. It enriches the area of ​​the image formed in this way. In addition, a somewhat unusual method called sewing is now used. The method of abstraction is maintained. And the screen becomes simpler. What on earth are we headed towards? conversation? In modern art education, Jaeyeon Hong chooses abstract painting. The meaning can be discussed together with the pursuit of modernity and tradition. To him, abstract art was contemporary and aesthetically pleasing, but something indigenous came into play here. It is a so-called calligraphy style. His paintings connect his own contemporaneity based on the history of Western art with the tradition of East Asian aesthetics. Regarding the flood of so-called contemporary art, is it anachronistic to still set artistry as a structure or relationship between visuality and spirituality? When dealing with his work, one cannot expect the ease of intermediate art such as photography. Also, there is no digital sense to be found. Still passionate about analog exploration. The spiritual in art is inseparable from his monkish temperament. Images formed through practice, rather than confirmed truths, are revealed in his paintings, prints, and ‘needle paintings.’ Mimesis Hong Jae-yeon's paintings are about forming organic nature or understanding nature organically and simplifying them. Even a small dot or line has its own meaning. Everything is meaningful to the writer. This means that mimesis operates as a principle that connects life and work. It can be said that for him, the distinction between pictorial representation and abstraction has already been transcended. Sewing has emerged in a world achieved through simple drawing and painting. Is it rude to writer Hong Jae-yeon to recall Henri Matisse’s ‘Origi’? There is a possibility that ontological and metaphysical exploration can be criticized as ahistorical, and the author deserves such misunderstanding in his understanding of Western art history. However, a gentle way to respond to this (Ron) seems to be sewing. When a screen that looks a bit like cosmology is presented to us with a less serious expression than before, we feel an aesthetic simplicity. If it is not pity, art supremacy, or the theory of art reflecting reality, is it the interest in life as a work of art that has captured Hong Jae-yeon? Perhaps the way of separating life and art, or in other words, abstracting it, makes this interpretation valid. Nevertheless, the attitude of considering the work method as the labor of life again integrates life into work. His painting aesthetics seem like a reflection on telos. An atmosphere of ultimate purpose exists on screen. With compassion for the little things!",

For each painting, I try to remain faithful to the spontaneous emotions at the time. So, the results drawn on the screen often include plants, animals, humans, and geometric shapes.

                explanation: "Everything vibrates me and the world with the theme of movement. Movement, one of the most powerful topics of modern art so far, is one of the important elements that defines the world and aesthetics. We would like to introduce artists who elevate this movement to the level of aesthetics. As the title of the exhibition titled “Trajectory” suggests, we would like to take a look at artists who use movement as a drawing and carry out aesthetic movement at another level. Artist Jeong Seok-woo's large-scale abstract paintings show movement on a broader level than the artist's own body. Jeong Seok-woo compares the movement of screen-paintings full of these kinetic characteristics with Mother Nature, which contains countless movements, when large-scale paintings leave the colorless and odorless exhibition hall and encounter the wide nature and world. Artist Johan Han records his every movement and makes it function as a musical element. All of Johan Han's movements and trajectories are DJ'd on the spot, and such DJing movements are also an element, creating a beautiful musical melody. As a result, Johan Han's DJing develops into a melody that draws his own trajectory and a metaphysical drawing. I am curious about what kind of trace Yohan Han, who leaves all his movements through melody and drawings, will leave behind. Artist Yunseop Kim plays a YouTube live video and draws a trajectory on a large canvas. You can see his tracks online, but strangely, you can't see his paintings. He creates paintings that can be seen in a physical studio but not online. His work, called the Blue Paiting series, uses a chroma key effect to make his paintings appear blank and shows only traces and traces, but the works to be displayed at the exhibition show two entities with specific shapes. What kind of work will his trajectory leave behind? Artist Kim Hyun-seok finds a certain movement behind the image. The source, use, transformation, and distortion of various elements that make up an image are his greatest interests. His persistence in finding the structure of the image and its transformation and movement is placed and filtered in the exhibition hall with its physical characteristics restored. What kind of new work will he, who works with the history of images itself as a trajectory, create? Schema Museum of Art seeks to focus on the movements of artists Seokwoo Jeong, Yohan Han, Yunseop Kim, and Hyunseok Kim, such as scribbling, inhaling, exhaling, and tracing. We hope to be able to show the four artists' trajectories and exhibit them at an aesthetic level at the Schema Art Museum, located alongside nature. Can we truly present the numerous movements contained in the world as one aesthetic? This is an exhibition to look forward to.",

                        text: "Artistic images, by themselves, reveal their original power again without having to borrow other senses. In this world of indiscriminate and flat images, if there is a place where the original power of images is more revealed, it would be online. I think the coronavirus spread around the time we began to think that the methodology of artistic images would also need to change in line with rapid technological and cultural changes. Dreaming of linking with the physical world we live in rather than an unconditional change to digitalized online content, I believe that the production of digitized images that belong to the physical world or are illusions themselves is inevitable. Moreover, from the perspective of accepting the post-corona era, I believe that this approach should be conducted and experimented with artistic and serious thinking. In this regard, the project I present takes a method of existing on the border between the images of the material world and the online world. The moment an image is accepted by people, a created image that has two different phases and forms will share with the audience a new experience that is separated from the original from the moment it is born. These experimental attempts require a clear online content production environment, and audiences will experience it both online and offline.",

The sound derived from the works vibrates the space at any moment.

                        text: "Visualizing the ‘already known’ of what is not recognized Based on interest in ‘how people’s wishful thinking manifests itself in daily life,’ the beauty of the energy emitted when a being moves toward something is expressed through painting. I am interested in the flow of consciousness formed through causal relationships and the culture of origin that permeates the commonwealth. There is a religious nuance to the work, and inspiration is drawn from the fundamental cultures of various religions. The topic I am currently exploring is about the consciousness of looking at possibilities. The cruelty that coexists with beauty is expressed through abstract painting by comparing it to the wild environment. The screen is constructed through constant repetition of meaning given both internally and externally to the work. I believe that everything in nature has a fundamental purpose. The nature referred to here is nature as a large unit, that is, the universe, which includes artificiality and presupposes an understanding that can embrace contradictions. The movement of energy toward a purpose is intense, interconnected, and coordinated by grand rules. It may be because of these rules that humans want to have dreams and goals, which are the driving force of life. The big theme that encompasses the work is ‘flow.’ Flow is directional energy heading somewhere. I don’t yet know where the flow’s destination point is or isn’t, but I think the traces of my worries and actions in the process of knowing that are the work itself.",

                explanation: "The artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition are new artists who have just graduated or are about to make a new start. The Shema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists and encourage the passion of new artists for their work in order to continuously establish a balance in local art every year. This exhibition supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition, and hopes to create new challenges and opportunities for local young artists and create an art ecosystem in our region. The ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition will be held in two parts, the ‘Unstable Possibilities 1’ exhibition will feature artists Dong-Woo Kim, Yuli Kim, Ju-Yeon Lim, So-Hee Park, and Min-Sol Choi, and the ‘Unstable Possibilities 2’ exhibition, which will be held in part 2, will feature artists Ra-Yeon Gil, Ra-Yeon Kim, and Na-Yun Song. A total of ten artists, including Wonju Yang and Sohee Ahn, participate in various genres including painting, photography, and fashion design. In particular, as Unstable Possibility implies, writers are unstable but contain infinite possibilities. Artists visualize unstable reason and their own perception of the world in various ways, and express their thoughts about the world we live in and art in their works, from their daily lives and individual stories.",

The programs combined with new and diverse contemporary art created a time of new emotion through empathy and expression for tired infants, children, and their families. This results report exhibition is a result reporting exhibition in the form of an archive and exhibition of the progress and process of cultural arts education conducted for a year with Yongjae Shin, a representative local sky recorder, and Solmoe Baek, an abstract sculpture artist. I believe that the exhibition is a time when participants in all programs can once again think about the importance of social arts education and the role of art museums, and establish the Shema Art Museum as a public cultural space and a space for communication with citizens. We invite you to the Schema Museum of Art's report on the results of cultural arts education.",

                explanation: "“Art is not a reproduction of the visible; it is making the invisible visible.” This is what Paul Klee said. Klee was born in Switzerland, but is an emotional and very rational writer who participated in the ‘Blue Knight Movement’ in Germany and also worked as a professor at the ‘Bauhaus.’ Because Klee was so good at realistic depictions, Surrealist artists invited him to join their group, but he declined and experimented with free drawing, exploring not only the strict cubic style but also pointillism. That is why the artist put more effort into expressing objects symbolically rather than realistically. Artist Lee Myung-hwa's work, like most other artists, begins with a realistic description of the object. Of course, you want to realize the image of the object through aesthetic expression, but you can see that you are trying to reproduce a new image by projecting your thoughts and life phenomena through the object you want to draw. Just as Klee drew visible objects, but did not try to draw what was visible, but rather what was invisible to the eye, artist Lee Myung-hwa not only tried to reproduce new images that could only be seen with his own eyes, but also drew on his own mind. We can guess that he is reconstructing the image he saw and felt. Artist Lee Myung-hwa is an artist who has been painting non-stop for almost 40 years, from his time in middle school to his participation in the art department, his time in college, and his completion of his master's degree in fine arts at Hongik University. As such, he is an artist who always thought about painting and immersed himself in his work, whether as a student, a middle school art teacher, or as a writer. In the meantime, I mainly worked on the subject of figurative landscapes and still lifes of all objects existing in nature, but quite a long time ago, I came across ‘Yeongeungkwi’, one of the many weeds. Thistle is a plant that, like all flowers, has an ecological process in which it germinates and grows in the soil, blooms, sends out its spore seeds, and settles in the soil again to complete its life for a year. As we observe the morphological characteristics of this thistle and re-observe it from the perspective of an internal perspective from the expression of an external image, the method of expression also changes. In this way, I think the <Thistle Flower> series works express the natural law of the creation and extinction of thistles by substituting it into the life of artist Lee Myung-hwa. Until now, expression techniques and forms can be summarized and explained as 'realistic expression', 'drawing expression', 'deconstructive expression of image', etc., but they are not bound by the realism of traditional Western painting and neo-impressionist expression techniques and cherish the space of the background of the image. By processing it, it gives the impression that it is borrowing the spirit of inaction and nature from Eastern thought. While realist paintings attempted to create the illusion of three-dimensional visual truth, Myung-Hwa Lee's works attempted to interpret the expression of illusionary images as more 'illusion', emphasizing the 'beauty of blank space' like the conceptual landscape paintings of Oriental paintings, and moving away from postmodernism. You can discover features that provide a glimpse into the 'vitality' of nature, which is important. In this way, 'Artist Lee Myung-hwa' and 'Thistle' are not opposing objects such as the artist and the object, but rather the subject and self that exist in nature, called the thistle, by uniting with the spirit of Eastern art, thereby raising questions about the essence of human life and, by extension, the existence of one's own life. You can feel that you want to talk about it too. Jean-Paul Sartre, a world-renowned existentialist philosopher, said, “From birth, humans are a series of choices between life and death.” Humans exist as part of nature. Ultimately, humans live in compliance with the birth and extinction of life in nature. In addition, the artist creates a work by dissolving his thoughts into the work and solving the answer through the technique and form of the work. From the formal point of view of the subject matter, Lee Myung-hwa's work can be interpreted in several characteristic forms. First, it can be interpreted that he is creating an aesthetic object that can simultaneously recognize the continuity and temporality of the birth and extinction of life in the thistle flower. Ultimately, it refers to the characteristic of recognizing the ‘reality’ of ‘thistle’ while simultaneously deconstructing itself. Second, we see that the object (image) and space (blank space) do not exist separately but exist simultaneously. It allows the blank space that is not drawn in an oriental painting to exist at the same time as if it exists as a part of a complete work rather than an unfinished part of the work. In this way, it seems that artist Lee Myung-hwa is using thistles to create the ‘mystery of nature’ and the ‘soft blank space’ as a space for the artist’s own internal expression. With this special exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art, we hope to make another leap forward by reflecting the external environment in a more unique way in the production method of these works, and by discovering and attempting new topics with artist Lee Myung-hwa's own subjective life and emotions.",

                explanation: "Painting has gone through many formal changes, from the Altamira cave paintings of the Paleolithic era about 35,000 years ago to the modern art of the 21st century, reaching its current state of art. However, from the perspective of the history of painting, we can point out a few of the most important events. The first event is the ‘invention of perspective’. It developed from around the 3rd century through the study of ‘Linear Perspective’ scholars Alberti and Brunelleschi, and was completed in the Renaissance era at the end of the 15th century, blossoming in realist painting in the 19th century. The characteristic of realist painting is not only the form of perspective, but also the principle of ‘light and dark’. The life of realist painting lies in the ‘perception of depth’ (Deep concept). Therefore, perspective and light and shade are the most important factors in making a two-dimensional screen (canvas) into an optical illusion that appears as a three-dimensional illusion. The second event was Picasso’s invention of ‘Cubism’, which dismantled realism. If realism is a technique based on one-focus perspective, Cubism completely dismantles the object and structure of the picture by viewing the object as multi-focal. Therefore, it would not be wrong at all to say that all abstract paintings that appeared after the emergence of Cubism were also originated by Cubism. The third case is Nam June Paik’s ‘Video Art’. Although the medium called ‘video’ was created by a scientist, ‘video art’ was created by Nam June Paik. There have been many changes in painting from primitive art to abstract art, but in terms of technique, the painting tools (charcoal, pencil, ink, pastel, conte, tempera, oil paint, acrylic, etc.) and the background (paper, wooden board, cloth, etc.) It is made by joining together (canvas, etc.). ‘Video art’ has completely destroyed these traditional characteristics of two-dimensional painting. Video art relies on the camera eye (lens) for both perspective and light and shade, so traditional painting techniques are excluded. Just as the ‘COVID-19’ virus mutates and mutates, the techniques and forms of ‘paintings’ are also being created as new forms follow the destruction and change of forms. Western painter Son Mi-ryang captured the form of his work from the negative images of photographic originals or camera films, which were common before the advent of media such as smartphones. Philip's original print shows the image in the exact opposite contrast to the printed photo. Artist Son Mi-ryang's work is a figurative image, but because it is composed of negatives, the perspective, light and shade of traditional figurative painting have all become unnecessary elements. While converting black and white on a computer to see the light and dark, artist Son Mi-ryang accidentally discovered a mysterious phenomenon in the negative screen. He witnessed the 'phenomenon of light and dark that appears to be the exact opposite' and 'the gray phenomenon of images reversed by complementary colors' and observed that Columbus had arrived in the New World. He confesses that he fell into a joy like the joy of discovering. And it can be seen that the artist is struggling to create his own techniques to efficiently implement these negative works. For example, you can see that an attempt is made to create a world of complementary colors emitted by gray light by limiting it to complementary colors. In addition, negative paintings reproduce images by reversing light and dark, but in terms of techniques, there are techniques such as 'Grazing', 'Sfumato', 'Scumbling', and 'Grisaille'. You can see that they are trying to save their image by applying traditional Tableau techniques. There are quite a few examples of works that use photographic originals in paintings. Lambert Maria's “LMW Pressag” (made in 1976) created a portrait from the negative of the person's film original, and Jurgen Klauke's work “Fotoarbeit” (made in 1986) This work depicts the scene of an operating room using a negative technique. There are quite a few examples of applying the negative development of film originals to paintings. However, I think there are very few cases in Korean modern painting where works are composed using negative techniques. Therefore, it can be thought that Son Mi-ryang's negative paintings are created while sharing the characteristics of realism, abstract painting, and video art in the painting style. However, in order to become a more creative painting, the screen must be reconstructed as a negative phenomenon rather than a depiction of negative reality. Contemporary artists must reorganize their works into a specific language structure. An artist's ability must be able to intuitively recognize a subject or idea, omit it, and change it. This is because art, especially art, purifies and simplifies external reality and the artist's own inner world, while newly constructing it according to the laws of the artist's inner world and expressing its essence. The essence is that a writer can become a successful writer when he or she can form his own unique image and objectify his inner truth, subjective life, and emotions.",
