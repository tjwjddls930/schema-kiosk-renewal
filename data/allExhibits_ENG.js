                        text: "I don't really think about conveying a strong message through my paintings. So I don't have a specific plan about what to draw before starting work. But on the other hand, because I don't have a plan, I feel vague and scared every time I look at the screen, so it feels like I'm trapped in the dark. In each painting, I try to remain faithful to the spontaneous emotions at the time. To me, the amplitude of meaning given by the expressed object is not that great. Because I know that the concrete objects expressed are not the final thing I intend to intend.",

                explanation: "2024 Schema Museum Kim Yeon-ok Special Invitational Exhibition – Secret Garden: Being able to observe nature more closely due to changes in living environment brought about a new change in my painting style. The keyword of my work is life. After a short period of interest and observation, I realized that living things obtain what they deserve through constant busyness. Being alive and having life was something that was naturally given to me without even having to think about it. I was amazed to see the various variations that organic life forms show through the passage of seasons and changes in time. Life activities continuously generate and consume energy, and the process of evolution while struggling for survival and growth is even amazing. A blade of grass squeezing out of a crevice in a stone discovered by chance, a tenacious life force peeking out from a seed abandoned on uncultivated land, and nature, which continuously repeats birth and transformation, is an antidote to modern civilization and a shelter given to humans by God. do. The division of cells seen through a microscope is a real shape, but there is another world inside it that we cannot normally perceive. The world where concrete shapes or abstractions that cannot be expressed in words unfolds is the beginning of freedom, and that is where my world lies. Based on a subjective sense of aesthetics, looking into plants begins in earnest with interest in the self and inner spirituality, and in order to convey the anchoring point of the observed feeling, various combinations of dots, lines, planes, textures, sizes, directions, and colors are used in the picture. It was used as a temporal and spatial element. In this exhibition, we hope to create implicit communication with visitors about the kindness shown by nature without having to reproduce any object by leaving only traces of the senses of reproduction, circulation, and movement of life.",

It was planned to reflect on the meaning by expressing and recognizing it. Over the past 20 years, Later Aspect and RING ART have held various international exchange exhibitions of contemporary art, such as the 2021 Korea-Japan International Exchange Exhibition “Conversing Climate”, 2016 Nagasaki’s “Spring Wind from Nagasaki”, and “8+9 Peace Exhibition”. Issues of uniqueness and diversity in art have been created into new art. The 10 artists from each country who will participate in this exhibition plan to conduct seminars and projects together. By participating in the process where artistic communication becomes a symbol and message, we hope to raise awareness and think about and empathize with the war and chaos occurring around the world. In particular, the paper crane citizen participation performance to be held on May 4th will run from May 4th, 2024 (Saturday) to May 4th, 2025 (12 months), and will be installed at the 《2025 RING ART '80 Years of Nagasaki Atomic Bombing'》 exhibition.

                        text: "Kang Cheol-gyu (b. 1990) depicts the narrative of a fictional world with realistic strokes. The mysterious other world within the canvas is a landscape that metaphorically projects his own reality. People, animals, and symbolic events in exotic nature are Each of them is closely related to his emotions and psychology. The shape of the black sphere that appears in <Enemy> (2023) is the physical manifestation of a complex of difficult emotions such as anxiety, obsession, expectation and delusion, disappointment and depression. The author's reality sometimes feels extremely hopeless, as in 〈The Big One〉(2023), where he does not flinch even when a single spear hits the target. In 〈Hunting Journal〉(2023), the character who prepares raw wild meat for a living is incomplete. It is depicted as a well-segmented body and an ego divided into several parts.",

Second is the narrative in the surreal genre of fantasy, and third is the narrative in reality-running. The three narratives intertwine and influence each other, completing one image. This work will be about creating various figurative materials from the three branches above and creating images and surfaces that fit them. In addition, there was a desire to express the great truths such as ‘just go’ and ‘just go’ in Buddhism, and ‘stay active’ in exercise philosophy.",

Son Hee-min's sculptures, created by tracing the materiality and form of living things and the flow of evolution through coincidence and adaptation, are a medium that conveys the meaning of life through art. Son Hee-min has expressed the social perception system surrounding living things, the physical properties and forms of living things that change depending on the environment, and the concept of evolution in a variety of sculptures. He mainly used biologist information and visuals, casting replication techniques, and artificial synthetic resin to create his works. Produce. We aim to recreate through imagination the parts that are distorted in the conceptualization of biology, and utilize language that is lost in the process of uttering information to present the sense of life and living things through the intuition of sculpture.",

In the process of discovering structural similarities between the past work flow and nature, and exploring the mechanisms that interlock and function in nature, the spatial staging of creation has become more evident through recent works related to the elements of the universe, such as the moon, solar eclipse, and the law of gravity.

By renewing tradition and adding characteristics that stand out in contemporary culture, we are creating sculpture as a record by taking over the question of what sculpture reflects the spirit of the times. In a visual field where art that exists in reality through materials, including sculpture, is reproduced as images, rather than seeking out the reason why sculpture must exist as a material, we should consider what other forms it can exist in and its newly given function and form. there is.",

This project seeks to expand its role beyond a simple exhibition into a platform that promotes networking among artists, exchanges feedback on each other's work, and promotes joint growth. Through these efforts, the Schema Museum of Art hopes to add artistic diversity and inclusion to the local community and become a space where young artists can voice their voices. In this exhibition, young artists visually express their inner worlds and reconstruct their personal experiences and everyday perceptions into new forms. This process goes beyond simple artistic expression and serves as an important means of communication and connection with the audience. 'Ground of Artistic Sense 1/2' will provide young artists with the opportunity to freely explore their identity and senses, and will be a space to expand mutual understanding and empathy by sharing their artistic journey with visitors. This is an important process that shows that art can start with individual creativity and passion and form relationships with the wider community. Through this exhibition, it is not only about displaying works, but also helping young artists build their careers and create art. By providing opportunities to enter the market and explore their own identity, we hope to share the feelings they feel during their creative process and contribute to building a sustainable art ecosystem.",

                explanation: "Through his <Cloud Tree> and <Ideal Garden> series, artist Go-Woon Lee has projected his emotions into real spaces such as parks, forests, and the sea, depicting the psychological landscape of the utopia of healing through media such as drawings, paintings, and animations. It has been expressed through. The coloring method, which creates a unique texture through the repeated process of painting and grinding paint on the canvas, and the delicate, warm tones of the screen drawn after adding subtle sparkle to the paper, create a dreamy atmosphere in the work. In addition, the animation, produced by compiling and editing hundreds of hand-drawn drawings and adding sound with low humming, attempts to connect emotionally with the audience. Artist Go-Woon Lee's work feels extremely unrealistic yet familiar at the same time, and the images in the work seem like something we've seen in a dream at least once, evoking the viewer's dreams, imagination, and memories. This “Lullaby in the Garden” exhibition unravels the time and space of the night garden, which the artist has been focusing on, through the metaphor of a lullaby. Like the melody of a soft lullaby that guides a child from the world of consciousness to the world of dreams, this exhibition allows you to set aside the logic and tension of everyday life and experience gentle relaxation through the work.",

                        text: "Goun Lee’s work begins from each day of his life. Although it is not a complete record of daily life, where you stay and what you see and feel is important. The author tries to maintain a slight distance from contemporary acute discourse and macro issues and to capture a state that is free from thoughts arising from external factors. At first, I focused on myself as a being in the world. A field of snow far away and a woman. The sea in the distance and the people on it. The dreamlike atmosphere that seems to meet reality and fantasy, created against the backdrop of nature, is a characteristic that has persisted from the beginning of Lee Go-un's work until recently. Not only the moon rainbow, but also memories of weather such as rain, snow, and clouds, the atmosphere of seasons such as spring and winter, and unfamiliar landscapes that seem to have escaped reality even though they are reality, become the starting point of the artist's imagination that connects the inner world with the external world. With the snow and rain in the background, people with faces that become one with the ‘cloud tree’ seem to stay in an imaginary space that allows free thinking like clouds. A being whose face, which most clearly reveals its identity, has disappeared allows it to escape the limited individuality defined by social norms and common notions. In fact, situations where snow accumulates and rain occur frequently in everyday life. But these are mysterious changes. Above all, snow and rain help us escape from reality. It interferes with clear vision. It blurs the boundaries, leaves room, and affects emotions. The world demands clear divisions. However, there are times when you want to erase all sections. Rain and snow make us take our feet off reality and have time to daydream. This is how the unknown space and time is imagined. After getting married and becoming a mother, Lee Go-un began drawing as if she were singing lullabies to her children. It wasn't something I specifically intended or planned. It was not intended to address the labor or practical hardships of women who became mothers. The more he focused on himself, the more images related to children appeared in his mind. It was as natural as water flowing and seasons changing. The toys in the work serve as excellent materials for weaving imagination. The reason why works containing memories of children are set at night is also connected to imagination. As is the case with snow and rain, sharp boundaries become blurred at night. The mysterious energy of the night provides languid comfort and tranquility free from the hustle and bustle of the day. Above all, for a child, night is a time to sleep and dream. The author imagines what kind of dreamland the child will enter. The author depicts dream time. A child's dream and the author's imagination intersect. The author falls into a daydream like that. Daydreaming is an activity of the thinking self (cogito). Dreamers are the state of the soul located below existence, above nothingness, and the masters of consciousness that explore the intermediate zone between reality and unreality and induce poetic daydreaming. Daydreaming is not a dream, which is an activity of the unconscious. Dreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness persists. Consciousness sustains and guides the dream. Meanwhile, the gardens and landscapes that often appear in Lee Go-un's works also exist in everyday life, but are based on memories related to fantastic situations that seem to escape daily life and experiences at travel destinations. The space Lee Go-un creates is like a romantic heterotopia. Heterotopia, which is different from real space and is not a utopia, is a unique space disconnected from daily life, but it is a space composed of incompatible heterogeneous elements that exist in reality. This time, the author floats across the border between reality and imagination, reality and fantasy. Moments where reality and unreality overlap are repeated, creating more room for the artist's imagination. In this way, the work method, attitude, and completed works that Lee Go-un has consistently pursued since the beginning are all closely related to imagination. Imagination begins with the perception of an image. The artist's imagination transforms the images received through perception. The external space and the internal space encourage each other and grow. A poetic space is created that allows for more possibilities than objective facts, and the inner space expands. Because imagination brings to mind images that are not visible in existing images, the artist discovers and expresses something hidden deep within the image. However, daydreaming, which is the main activity of imagination, is different from contemplation, which focuses on a specific problem and seeks a logical solution. It is a mental activity that occurs naturally through the activity of imagination without any clear will. However, because daydreaming is a mental activity in which the light of consciousness exists rather than an unconscious state such as dreaming, the author is able to place himself at the center as a thinking subject. A dream is an activity in a state that is neither completely unconscious nor completely conscious, an unreal function that does not belong to rationalistic reality, but has roots in the real world. In this somewhat dazed and comfortable state of daydreaming, the artist loosely and naturally conjures up images and daydreams. And then it unfolds in the work. Imagination, which can accept images and transform them independently, is universal, so we who look at Lee Go-un's works can also have diverse imaginations. Infinity, which can be said to be the philosophical category of daydreaming, is within us. It is connected to the expansion of existence that continues in solitude, even though real life suppresses and caution stops. The author (we) dreams of infinity in an infinite world. Let’s delve a little deeper into the warm space-time and infinite world presented by this work, which “begins and ends smoothly, free from intellectual labor.”",

                explanation: "2023 Schema Art Museum Gyemyo Year, the first exhibition of the new year ‘Ecole de Cheongju’ – Schema’s masterpiece exhibition is an exhibition of works from the collection that has another meaning. 2024 marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Schema Museum of Art. This collection exhibition is an exhibition that presents important works while thinking about the past 14 years. Works by the late artist who was a close friend of Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art. This is an exhibition planned while thinking and reminiscing about the precious works of close junior artists and artists who have participated in solo exhibitions at the Schema Art Museum. These are the collections of Ecole de Chemat, which presents paintings, photographs, and video works by a total of 13 artists. Artist Kim Jae-gwan's recent ‘Relationship’ series, among half a century of geometric abstract art works, depicts nature, breaking away from the work format that has long been approached through rational interpretation of geometric abstract structures. Rather than painting nature as a common-sense landscape, it is expressed as ‘natural phenomena’ – ‘light,’ ‘sound,’ ‘color,’ and ‘rhyme.’ Kim Young-bae (1947-2001) was a late artist who considered a unique methodology that served as a bridge between modernism and postmodernism. He experimented with new dimensions of painting by colliding pop and realism simultaneously, clashing lines and surfaces, concepts and layers, etc. He was a writer. He had an open attitude to various fields and was very interested in comics, so he served as a professor in the Department of Comics at Sangmyung University and trained many younger students. The “Untitled” series creates screens with repeated patterns through a combination of language such as figurative images and geometric patterns. Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he focuses on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. Artist Kim Jae-nam's <Lost Landscape> painting series collects sea images of specific locations containing cultural and social memories and presents them in an incomplete state through “defamiliarization.” In order to evoke memories as an interpretant, black charcoal is painted and rubbed repeatedly on the canvas countless times, replacing it with a simple black and white color plane involving the body. For artist Kim Seong-mi, the forest is an entity, and in recent years, the author has continued to use the forest as a motif to capture all aspects of change over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We search for ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work. Artist Park Jin-myeong is a representative modern orientalist artist in Cheongju. He expresses images that come to mind in his paintings. Certain scenes that pass by him in passing produce other memories and images, and by repeating the overlapping of those moments, they become a new scene and an afterimage. engraved with The image of the darkness with the moon floating on it and the moment below it overlapping and playing over and over again permeates the screen as a single scene. Artist Shim Jae-bun goes beyond the object ‘lotus flower’ and penetrates the essence of the object and recreates it in his own language. In order to reproduce the invisible existence of nature and humans, ‘ultra-telephoto lens’ and ‘ultra-wide-angle lens’ are used to capture nature that cannot be seen with the naked eye in a single image, creating a work of art that feels like a surreal fact. Artist Lee Hong-won strongly reveals Korean aesthetics through dazzling colors. The tigers and human figures that appear in the painting are based on tradition, but also imply accessibility to modern art. Freedom of subject matter or expression, simplification or exaggeration, boldness, and humorous aesthetics and humor are the main characteristics of Hongwon Lee's work, and the classics and modern times, the world of myth and the world of reality coexist in synchronicity. Artist Eunsoo Lim is an artist who embodies women's sensuality and senses with a sense of feminism. Due to her unique self-consciousness, she moves further away from the cogs of modernism and expresses her own critical awareness and new drawings through movement. From 2020 until recently, the artist has presented the current social, climate, and environmental phenomena through the performance ‘I am here now’ with a unique sense of comfort and circulation. In ‘I Am Here Now 7’, the author enters and joins the water circulation process of Daecheong Lake. And by expanding the self, it becomes an agent and mother of life, presenting through symbolic tools and actions what we truly value and protect in this era. Artist Jeon Yeon-il (1945-2021) captures the restoration of humanity lost due to the development of industry in modern society, and at the same time uses the five cardinal colors that our people have long revered and used very closely in their daily lives as the subject matter of his work. The five colors present modernized visualization works based on the joys, sorrows, etc. of our lives. The visualized work appears shamanistic yet primitive. Kisan artist Jeong Myeong-hee has unfolded the story of Geumgang and the universe with a variety of materials and colors, focusing on Hanji and ink. In recent years, he has been talking about the fundamentals of life using black ink on a white background, comparing it to the spirit of literary painting. The birds of Kisan fill the screen, appearing in black ink or as blank space. Lee divides the canvas with a fundamental form resembling a cross, visualizing life as freely flying. Artist Cho Hyun-ae captures ‘time’ on canvas. The artist's work, where lost time and present time coexist, contains the accumulation of time in the space the artist creates. In particular, in the artist's virtual space, images of the past and present coexist, and landscape paintings, genre paintings, and Western masterpieces from the Joseon Dynasty come together to form multiple layers of space and overlap. The coexistence of past and present within a two-dimensional plane forms the artist’s own ‘surreal’ world and creates a visual metaphor. Artist Choi Min-geon expresses our enjoyment of wandering between virtuality and reality, subject and object, due to the ambiguity of boundaries. The dog that creates an optical illusion on the screen blurs the boundary between virtuality and reality, and expresses the appearance of dogs, the most familiar of humans and other animals, making us feel different from us and at the same time feel homogeneous.",

                explanation: "The Soft Life exhibition invites artists who instill a warm or new perspective on those around them without being shaken while living in a dynamic modern society. The four artists who look at the various peripheries of everyday life and create new images using everyday events and images make us think that they are not only creators, but also existential in themselves. Their methodology, which is revealed while composing events and images, consists of figurative painting and seeks to enter each person's world. Artist Park Hae-bin travels between Jeju Island and Cheongju, accumulating imprinted images and various events in her paintings. His works, which expose the illusion of the flat surface or reproduce dense compositions with small strokes, attempt to go beyond the limits of representation and enter a new world of representation, experimenting with its methodology. His work, which collects images from around him and devotes himself to various methods of painting, evokes unfamiliarity and curiosity in the audience. Artist Minjeong Seo deals with events and images by intersecting the dog's gaze with her own. It can be inferred that it took a long time for the various delicate emotional events and chunks of images left in the mind to be finalized and composed as his material. He composes landscapes containing the wild nature and origins of plants, constructs the landscape of the mind, and reveals images as if stacking them up using the unique methodology of oriental painting, layer by layer. Artist Gyu-seon Lee finds and expresses images that resonate with his psychological environment between his repetitive daily life and the landscapes that come and go. The whirlpool of the Mindless Stream, the scenery of Cheongju, and the characters help us infer his harsh, dry, yet living world. His realism shows himself unfiltered, with quick strokes and expressions. Artist Cho Min-ah unfolds on screen the contradictions, absurdities, and jokes that occur in everyday life. He envisions several fragmentary events, expresses them, and expands them. On these screens, the audience can watch him perform his unique work and see the artist's imaginary trajectory. We want to show the world of today's painters through the lives of the four artists above, as they gently unfold them.",

                        text: "Over a long history, the landscape we live in has undergone many changes. Even at this moment, the landscape is changing. For painters of the past, landscapes have constantly been the subject matter of their works. As a painter living in modern times, I always worry about what kind of landscape to draw and how to paint it. During the two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent time looking more intently at the world around me. It was an opportunity to go into nature where no one was around, meditate, and have a more diverse visual experience. The landscape I see and draw is on the border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction, familiarity and unfamiliarity. Based on my unique visual experience, I reconstructed the landscape of reality where the heterogeneous emotions of familiarity and unfamiliarity coexist, and created cross-sections of the landscape at the psychological border between reality and unreality, reality and fiction through two-dimensional painting work. I want to show you. This clearly originates from visual perception of the real world, but it is not simply a reflection of real space, but creates another space through mental processes. Through a landscape that seems to contain a hidden story that cannot be fully known just by looking at it, we can look at things that we could not or have not seen in reality due to familiarity, and psychologically understand the heterogeneous emotions such as familiarity and unfamiliarity that exist in each individual's subconscious. We aim to arouse curiosity about boundaries.",

That may not be the case, but if you only pursue something different every time, that would also be close to a lie. That's what life is like. It's ordinary. However, even in that moment, even in an ordinary day, there are definitely times when you discover something shining. Numerous stories, conversations, passage of time, repetitive daily life and faces of groups. An image, that is, a certain image. Big and small everyday experiences and pieces of life that are scattered, broken, and emerging. image. Because of that image, I feel pain that I don't need to feel and struggle to hold on to it. The tough stories of life and the people in those stories that sometimes make you feel shut out and sometimes feel grateful. Something that cannot be resolved from embodied moments is because of images. I struggle because I want to recall that image, capture it, and express it. Relationships with many people and something invisible. A Self-Portrait in which the qualities of the relationship and encounter intersect and the physical properties are mixed, but this is not as intended. Confronted self-portrait. Life situations that cannot be avoided or ignored. Moments that must always be encountered in an organic form. Maybe I didn't want to draw myself. I wanted to express it in some other form, but I may also have faced limitations in my own objectivity. The subtle and generative expressions of a knife's touch or an oil painting, and the intersection of physical properties form a certain shape - it is an image, but it does not constitute an image - to achieve something else. Because the action and method were not intended or recognized movements, the direction of the brush moving between strokes manifests itself as meaningless brush strokes with an abstract nature. It sounds obvious, it's obvious, but it's an ordinary and natural thing to live. Life and daily life that are like an unavoidable experience in life and an organic living life. A vibrant life where cells come together, scatter, and move. Organic relationships that are inevitable and sometimes petty. The struggle to find and obsess over pictoriality within that ‘organic relationship.’ It is an image that is close but also far away. A self-portrait drawn like that. So anyway, I will draw again. I will probably draw again in this inseparable relationship, as if I were living a life that I could not avoid or ignore. The self-portrait I draw like that may not be a self-portrait.",

                        text: "Personal attitudes that constantly change depending on the situation, fluid value judgments, and the way we currently live in balance as if weighing scales always create dynamic energies. I thought that the cracks and harmony that occurred within it were natural things that came from different people living together. Reminiscent of a dream-like situation where some people live in the future and some people live in the past and the present intersects, I started thinking about those who are waiting in a messy space for something in the future that will not come, or for something that can change the present. Just like Tetris blocks of different shapes are put together and destroyed, we wanted to tell the story of our daily lives and reality in the relationship between individuals who own the present and the relationships surrounding them, despite the complexity of coexisting with others. Symbols or objects with symbolic meaning appear, but there is a universal symbol that everyone recognizes, and when I think about it and make it meaningful, I draw those elements in the picture. Working while creating allegory is attractive because it has a double meaning, but it is not the main element of my work. There are cases where colors or lines are introduced as figurative images to harmonize the screen composition. Because the work comes out of that process, there is a narrative, but there seem to be parts that are not understood. Although causal relationships and connection points between objects and people are important, the basic foundation for their combination begins with a sense of formative balance. Although it is not understandable at a glance, I hope that it will be seen as a personal narrative or as a work that reminds us of our current lives, using the situation, color, and atmosphere shown in the painting as a clue.",

                        text: "Recent work is an attempt to attach the idea that ‘the world is constantly broken and rebuilt again’ into the images and working process of each painting. I question whether the large and small violence we experience, alienation from lack of communication, emptiness, or complex and confusing scenes and fears that are difficult to interpret may be a very obvious order or an axis toward balance, albeit disturbing. Through my work, I am struggling between ambivalent things, being alienated, hurt, and unable to do either this or that, such as communication and non-communication, ideal and reality, open and closed, the desire to speak and the desire to be silent, the positivity and positivity applied to the same event. Pay attention to things like negative attitudes and the emotions at the time. The ink and ink drawings move toward breaking the object, and the color pigments (powder paint) jostle against each other in a movement to find the object, but the boundaries naturally collapse during the work process. Through the process of repeatedly breaking and putting back together, we ask ourselves how we can make meaning of the fragmented and confusing structure of the world and unclear experiences and memories. I have expressed countless moments of alienated emotions and feelings, such as individual and universal hardships in life, various pains and wounds, repeated failures, and idling, by borrowing the lush structure of untouched nature. There are conflicting impulses in everything, and we are constantly concerned about contradictions, trying to engage with them, organize them, understand them, and think about what might be better. That fight can be expressed in many different languages, but to me, it feels most clearly as the force trying to fragment and the force trying to build. Part of my world is broken and experienced loss due to certain events, and only after going through the process of reassembling or accepting it, that is, the process of building, can I move on to the next journey. Perhaps the process of fragmentation and construction itself is movement. What is clear is that breaking and fragmenting do not represent negativity, or conversely, building does not represent positivity. These are like different signals that cause things to move in slightly different directions and change shape.",

                explanation: "Bang Hyo-seong's work uses borderless language, crossing the boundaries of place and time, consciousness and unconsciousness, solemnity and kitsch, and philosophy and episode. All beings who think according to the order of creation are born with meaning, and within a given period of time, that meaning may be discovered or disappear for a moment. In a world where the visible and the invisible coexist, I work to reveal the visible and the invisible. All living things and the material world have a given time. Nothing is permanent, just long and short, and it repeats creation and extinction. The author talks about thoughts about all things located in space and time in the language of transcending boundaries. Everything changes. By time. The phenomena that have emerged in the present time speak across the material world and the spiritual world. The time of now includes eternity and may disappear after a while. I spend a long time thinking about what the essence of the object I am pursuing is. Essence is something that comes before recognition, and there is a bias between essence and non-essence. Essence cannot take precedence over existence. Existence exists as existence and non-existence, but its essence is nothing more than a momentary perception that cannot be defined in time. What do we see, feel, and perceive, whether it is an object or a mental thing? Perception has imperfections, illusions, prejudices, absurdities, and ambiguities. Regarding the fact that the world of material, which is only a part of the world of spirit, is easily visible to the eye, I question whether the world of spirit is obsessed with prejudice that obscures its essence due to the fixation of ideas. My work gives meaning to the inherent properties of materials. The essence of my objects or philosophy may also be another essence interpreted by me. There is an instinctive desire to pursue eternity in time that repeats creation and extinction. Everything disappears with time. As an invested being, everything, including me, forms a dynamic structure in the relationship between the visible and the invisible in the material and spiritual world. It is a work that materializes spiritual things through formative language. Think about what art placed in eternal time is trying to show. Materials that exist in the moment have value as works of art created wearing the clothes of imagination. This existence also exists only for a moment as it heads toward extinction. Various symbols are borrowed and used in my work. There are many formative elements that symbolically express things that arise in latent consciousness through image collection. Humans create and use symbol systems to communicate with each other. Ambiguous symbols of inability to communicate are sometimes used. These are things written as formative images. This exhibition is based on the phenomenology of mental communication in symbol systems. It is the work of replacing material with mental and mental with material. Materials imaged in a minimalistic work style through drawings and some installations. I want to show the spiritual value and structure of the material. For Sartre, existence precedes essence. This means that essence changes with time, and recognition of essence gives meaning to existence. However, perception is incomplete and is a process that takes place in time. Cognition is a part of the essence and is placed within the scope of the world through reason. Existence is the fact that it exists, and it exists in meaninglessness, such as a certain role, personality, direction, etc. Having meaning in existence is the essence of its existence, and that essence becomes explanatory. All beings change over time and their essence also changes. Essence is named by its use and given meaning by the language in which it is named. A being whose purpose is unknown or unfamiliar can be explained as existing outside the world, or in other words, an inexperienced being. However, since existence and non-existence have a counterpart, it can be a relationship between the immediate and the for-itself. Rationality is a subset of absurdity. In other words, complete cognition or rationality does not exist. Because the essence changes, a perfect combination is impossible. In the human world, language and emotions are communicated through an incomplete recognition system due to imperfect communication, and communication is also a broken part of recognition. we all know I understand. It gives legitimacy to the fiction and completes communication. However, there is no language that perfectly expresses our thoughts. ‘Be silent about things you cannot speak of,’ says Wittgenstein.",

                explanation: "This year, the Schema Museum of Art celebrates its 14th anniversary. For the past 14 years, the Schema Museum of Art, as a representative contemporary art museum in the region, has been pursuing art that breathes with the new era and the future and exhibitions that converge with other fields. In addition, it reflected the trends of the times and social phenomena, established the identity of the museum through various thematic exhibitions and international exchange exhibitions for the development of contemporary art in the Cheongju region, and established itself as a representative private art museum in Korea beyond the region. Since opening in 2009, the Schema Museum of Art has strived to serve as a regional international exchange center by hosting various contemporary art exhibitions. The 10-year narrative of the Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition began with the 1st Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition ‘New ASIA·Sympathy & Difference’ held on November 14, 2014. In particular, the international exchange exhibition began with Governor Lee Si-jong's love of art and his wish to create a representative international contemporary art exhibition in Cheongju. Without this interest and support from Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City, the current 10 years of international exchanges would not have occurred. As we welcome the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, I would like to express my deep gratitude once again, as it began with the decision of former Governor Lee Si-jong. In addition, we would like to once again thank Chungcheongbuk-do Governor Kim Young-hwan and Cheongju City Mayor Lee Beom-seok for their help in hosting the 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition. ‘10 years’ is called ‘Decade’ in English. There is a deep metaphor latent in these words. In other words, the word 10 years is used in the West to mean, “A new paradigm begins in 10 years,” just as in Korea there is a saying, “Even rivers and mountains change in 10 years.” 2014 1st – New ASIA · Sympathy & Difference 2015 2nd – After the 90’s Tanamura·Jinmok era, Korean and Japanese contemporary art and about the present 2016 3rd – New dream New future 2017 4th – After Hyecho – Korea · Communication of Indian Cultures 2018 5th – Korean-French Contemporary Art ‘New Dialogue’ 2019 6th – French International Exchange Exhibition ‘2019 New Dialogue’ 2020 7th – Korea-France Korean Artists 2021 8th – Korea-Japan International Exchange Exhibition - Climate of Dialogue Again 2022 9th – New Coordinates of Korean-China Contemporary Art 2023 10th – Retrospective of Cheongju International Contemporary Art Decade and Prospects for a New Future Meanwhile, Asian Exchange Exhibition, Korea-China-Japan Exhibition, Korea-China Exhibition, We have held quite a few international exchange exhibitions, including the Korea-Japan Exhibition, Korea-India Exhibition, Korea-Netherlands Exchange Exhibition, Korea-Bosnia Exchange Exhibition, and Korea-France Exchange Exhibition. However, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the format of the exhibition changed and the mechanism of the exhibition changed to a new pattern using online video media. After such a difficult time, I feel truly fortunate and happy that all the participating artists were able to gather together for the 23rd year of the international exchange exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art in Cheongju. The 10th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition features 10 Korean artists (Jae-gwan Kim, Jeong-hee Kim, Jae-nam Kim, Yoon-hee Seo, Jae-bun Shim, Sang-wook Moon, Eun-soo Lim, Ik-gyu Choi, Hyo-seong Bang, and Eun-young Heo) as well as participants from China, Japan, Thailand, India, the Netherlands, and Bosnia. 11 people (Cang Xin, Chen Gang, Uno Kazuyuki, Hasegawa Ichirou, Kongsak Gulglangdon, Thawatchai Changkwien, 21 authors, including Ajitvar Kumar Douglas, Ravi Ranjan, Pietertje van Splunter, Jessy Rahman, and Jusuf Hadẑifejzović It is an international contemporary art festival in which artists participate. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Schema Museum of Art hosting an international contemporary art exhibition. Among the foreign artists participating in this international exhibition, Cang Xin (China) and Jusuf Hadžifejzović (Bosnia) are already internationally renowned. The 10 Korean artists also comprised of those who have been evaluated as the most creative artists in international exhibitions. Therefore, I have no doubt that this exhibition will be a ‘Decade’ that looks back on the past 10 years and at the same time promises a new 10 years. We would like to once again express our deepest gratitude to Chungcheongbuk-do and Cheongju City for their cooperation for this exhibition.",

                explanation: "2023. Late Aspect Exhibition - Beautifully Thinking Art In 2023, the Late Aspect Contemporary Art Association plans to hold an exhibition under the theme of ‘Beautifully Thinking Art.’ Currently, before we have even escaped the coronavirus crisis, we are facing a society that is rapidly changing again due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. All people on Earth feel threatened by an unstable future. Nevertheless, we must face these overall problems and phenomena, overcome them, accept them, and find a way out by combining them with our respective realities. This may be because life changes, continues, and deepens under any circumstances. What is the vitality that instills the will to live in an unsettling reality? It can be said that fundamental introspection is necessary in each person's own position. As the biggest core of accepting the variations and mutations of the art ecosystem, we plan to organize an exhibition with the meaning of ‘meeting a new era with beautifully thought-out art.’",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed according to the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. The 'Smooth Stone Field' exhibition explores how the material world and the world of metaphysics are related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence this has on modern art. Modern art artists are the generation with the smoothest surface in human history. This exhibition examines how things still exist as part of the material world and how they interact and work. The 'Smooth Stone Field 1' exhibition features four artists, Kim Man-sun, Kim Yun-seop, Lee Byeong-ho, and Cho Min-seon, who basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and use the body represented by material to show what significance this method has for us and what methods it will take in the future. It was a time to open our eyes to the times and it was an exhibition to think about. Smooth Stone Field 2, which continues for 23 years, is an exhibition that reconsiders the modern flatness with a monitor, represented by rare earth elements, as the surface. This is to examine whether the consideration of the two-dimensionality created by humans since ancient times can be interpreted into the realm of art and to deal with artists who use it to present their work using new methodologies. Artist Minjeong Geum focuses on creating new surface compositions by mixing the surface of the monitor with materials such as wood and stone. All of her sculptures present a new form of sculptural sculpture by actively revealing material properties taken from nature. As a first-generation Korean media artist, artist Kim Jun has used the topic of tattoos to assess the issue of expression where an individual's identity is revealed to the surface. As a media work created with a 3D program, it can be said to represent data properties before NFT. Author Yunseong Lee is one of the most active NFT artists of his time and is creating a new myth of flatness by substituting otaku culture into mythology. He is at the cutting edge of NFT work with his continued interest in online virtual worlds. It uses stories produced from Greek and Roman myths and legends as a motif, and uses expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga and moe as its format. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. Seungcheol Ok is an artist who creates large-scale paintings and sculptures that reveal the expressions and faces of characters, and experiments with what kind of visual situations they create in online and virtual environments. The artist, who is also famous for collaborating with various genres, transforms new experiments with the flat surface into various forms of collaborative works. In modern times, flatness is not a very rare space. However, the newly expanded concept of flatness is progressing beyond online and through conversion into data, with different physical properties. We pay attention to how contemporary art works interact with and communicate with audiences using new and changing materials, and reconsider the flatness of modern times through the works of four participating artists: Minjeong Geum, Jun Kim, Yunseong Lee, and Seungcheol Ok. I want to see it.",

                        text: "The 2023 series of works used a material called concrete, a symbol of modern urban industrialization. My concrete frame is also a small symbol of urban architecture. By taking an image of a specific wall, the natural phenomena (wind movement, light and shadow movement) and light and shadow movements collected at that location are converted into data and reacted to the movement of the video image. Then, the video result is mixed with the concrete sculpture frame. In addition, in 2021, a video created by filming the natural phenomenon of a specific place called 'Soswaewon' in Damyang and reacting to the image of the building of that place will be presented along with sculpture and formative elements inspired by the actual building. It was produced by mixing and matching videos. Natural phenomena are areas that humans cannot control. However, in this day and age, we have reached an era where computers can reproduce human emotions and natural phenomena. I had an interesting thought, “Wouldn’t it be possible in the future to predict, prevent, and change natural phenomena called natural disasters?” Natural phenomena that are closely related to human emotions sometimes provide realistic data for human survival. Technology affects both art and science.",

                        text: "“Ok Seung-cheol’s works, which seem to repeat the same thing every time, start from the belief that something new can be created through repetition. This belief clashes with the limitations of various contemporary production technologies every time his icons are converted/circulated into multiple media. In other words, when his paintings become sculptures or mirrors, when his paintings become images, and when his paintings are transferred to other canvases, the shapes hover between ideal and reality, subtly changing or weathering.”_Jeong Hyeon <Moo. -Excerpt from the Patina of the Time-Space-Continuum> Artist Ok Seung-cheol has been dealing with the issue of originality from the perspective of the post-digital era from the beginning of his career to the present. By using digital images as originals to print and share not only traditional media such as paintings and sculptures, but also the boundaries between reality and virtuality, and art and non-art, the irony of the intersection of light (digital original) images and heavy (art work) images is highlighted. The process in which an image is not fixed in one form, but interacts with it inside and out, materializing it into various forms and textures, and the coexistence of so-called lightness and seriousness created by the printed outer shell (a work of art that emphasizes infinitely replicable digital images and uniqueness) We present work that examines the meaning of originality from a new perspective by emphasizing the contradictions. In this exhibition, the artist thought of and organized the small exhibition hall itself as a format of a work rather than each work individually. From the flat painting <Portrait, 2023> to the video of <Never Again, 2018> projected on a projector, and the pair of mirrors that reflect it <Outline, 2022>, the flat-shaped multi-media work is composed to create a visual effect of various thin thicknesses. Presented to the audience. As the artist intended, it encourages people to experience appreciation and interpretation of points that cannot be satisfied with the physical form due to the limitations of flatness. In particular, <Face, 2023>, a double-sided relief in the form of a compressed flat sculpture without a frontal face, is a work in which only the same back view is shown repeatedly, without showing the face that the title suggests. By intentionally creating a feeling of frustration, the work questions the limitations of the flat image on the monitor screen and its essence. Additionally, the border, which is compressed with many layers stacked on top of each other, has its limitations.",

                        text: "I am interested in expressions revealed in old narratives and contemporary visual culture. Stories produced from myths and legends such as Greek and Roman mythology are used as motifs, and expression methods derived from subcultural images called manga or moe are used as the form. And this methodology is widely used not only for the subject and shape of the painting, but also for the shape and size of the frame, combination modules and composition methods, and color and technique. [Torso] was inspired by a damaged ancient Greek sculpture and the final scene of the theatrical version of the Japanese animation <Ghost in the Shell (1995)>. New images discovered among the destroyed bodies were transformed into a series of works, colliding with various elements such as gushing or flying blood drops, sparkling or exploding effects, and swirling space. [The Three Graces], a large painting based on the motif of the Three Graces from Greek mythology, has been a subject that has long inspired the artist. The work was done by referring to the most typical pose of the Three Graces and the characteristics of pretty girl cartoon characters. This work, which consists of ten pieces of canvas that come together to form one large screen, was created while thinking about what the images seen through palm-sized comic books or TV media would look like when they became the main characters of a large painting. The [Medusa] series, created as a series of paintings and digital sculpture videos, began with a single drawing. The drawings are the results of a process in which the drawings are produced as classic animation-style paintings, and then the virtual digital three-dimensional works created based on these are finally printed on a 3D printer and become physical sculptures. If paintings in the past were various attempts to reproduce reality on a flat surface, I thought that currently we are in the process of experimenting with how to reconstruct the already flat world or expand it into a new space.",

As I was walking along Naesudong-ro 102beon-gil, which I pass every day, without looking at the floor, I slowly began to notice things that I had considered indifferent. I looked closely at the low stone walls of various shapes and the weeds growing between the gaps in the sidewalk blocks. Walking slowly became my daily routine, wondering how I could grow through all that. Things that had been invisible until now began to appear. Falling leaves, cats leisurely passing by, the sound of footsteps of people passing by... It was a new feeling for me, who always walked looking straight ahead. And the weeds that had bloomed with persistent vitality suddenly began to look sad and beautiful. And I started drawing one by one the weeds I saw while walking along the path.",

                explanation: "The Schema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists who are consolidating their emotional inner self through paintings and to new artists who have just graduated or are about to start a new beginning. In order to maintain a sustainable balance in local art and build an art ecosystem, the Shema Art Museum holds a special event for young artists every year. Proceed. The 2023 Unstable Possibilities Exhibition is an exhibition that supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists and hopes to create an artistic ecosystem in our region by providing an opportunity for new challenges for local young artists. As Unstable Possibility implies, young writers are unstable, but contain infinite possibilities. We get a glimpse of new possibilities through the exhibition of young artists who visualize their unstable reason and their own perception of the world in various ways and express their thoughts about the world and art in their works, from the stories of individuals living in their daily lives. I want to see it. I would like to focus on the perspectives of young artists who have just graduated and are consolidating their emotional inner self through paintings by combining the cross-section and artist's perspective with the environment surrounding them and the artist's consciousness to create new creations. Part 1, who builds his own world by revealing aspects of life using fragmentary materials, Se-eun Kim, Soo-wan Kim, Yu-bin Kim, Ji-yeon Seo, Hae-in Shin, Eun-jeong Oh, Seon-jae Yoon, Do-hoon Lee, Ha-neul Lee, Hyeong-jun Jin Part 2 So-young Kwon, Do-hoon Kim, Ji-hoon Kim, Gyu-bong Shim, Seung-ji Lee , Kiyu, Jeong Young-hoon, Jeong Ji-yong, Han Ye-jin, and Hong Myeong-gi. We would like to introduce a total of 20 young writers.",

But on the other hand, because I don't have a plan, I feel vague and scared every time I look at the screen, so it feels like I'm trapped in the dark. In each painting, I try to remain faithful to the spontaneous emotions at the time. To me, the amplitude of meaning given by the expressed object is not that great. Because I know that the concrete objects expressed are not the final thing I intend to intend.",

In modern art, emotion refers to the artist's strong desire and creativity, and reason refers to the intellectual ability and technical skills that can realize emotion. Reason and emotion have maintained an absolute mutual relationship in modern art, and works are always progressing by repeating the dominance between reason and emotion. Participating artists include 16 artists: Seo-yeon Kim, Young-bae Kim, Jae-kwan Kim, Sang-wook Moon, Young-dae Park, Jin-myeong Park, Myeong-hee Shim, Jae-bun Shim, Seok-gyu Yoo, Seong-su Lim, Eun-su Lim, Yeon-il Jeon, Myung-hee Jeong, Hyun-ae Jo, Young-seop Han, and Moon-jeong Heo, and their works are completely different in format. It is an exhibition of collections of works that is organized and evokes sympathy between reason and emotion.",

                explanation: "Artist Kim Yeon-hee seeks to find symbolic images in her paintings from ‘meditative concepts.’ Black and white coexist in the artist's screen, and he puts emphasis on the beauty of simplicity. He develops the squares used in abstract works and uses them to compose space. The artist wants to capture the universe in a square, and the color is black. In the world of black, all colors are mixed and it is said to contain more concentrated power and beauty than any other color. For the artist, the color of ink is a sample color made with acrylic. As can be seen in the form of artist Kim Yeon-hee's series of works, most of the works were acquired through independent research and were influenced by the 'minimal art' and 'minimal art' that were prevalent as trends in late modern art. It can be seen that efforts were made to share the spirit of 'monochrome painting' and 'conceptual art'. It can be seen that these ideas became the basis of ‘Korean monochrome painting’, in which the spirit and ideas of Eastern thought emerged as an important new alternative from a Western perspective centered on material civilization. In modern art, a phenomenon of moderation and simplification of color and composition, while emphasizing the blank space and spatiality of the picture appears due to the influence of the Eastern thought of ‘inaction’ and the Buddhist idea of ​​‘emptiness’. The purity of artist Kim Yeon-hee's paintings shows that these oriental ideas are accepted as the background for the embodiment of aesthetic value. We see that this concept is accepted and expanded in the paintings of the artist's spirit, and that materiality and media overlap and dissolve into the image of the work in the form of contingency. The symbols in artist Kim Yeon-hee's work are arranged throughout the work and appear as symbolic and lyrical images, conveying implicit meaning. It can be seen that the ‘Flowing’ and ‘Automatism’ techniques that the artist is borrowing as expression techniques are being applied as formative forms that compose the screen with freely intended physical properties. As can be seen in the works since 2015 and the text abstract works, 'language' and 'ideology', which were chosen as an alternative method to 'object art' in the early 70s, are used as an alternative to 'art' and 'statement'. It can be seen that they were also fascinated by the ‘language’ and ‘characters’ of the conceptual artists who presented them. We see that this verbal description is determined by the representation of black monochrome painting. This large-scale monochrome work seems to have reinterpreted the medium of painting and expanded its scope, based on the relationship between shape and background and the method of developing one's own aesthetics through subtle harmony of colors in a color field that is vaguely rectangular. In most of the works of these artists, we can see that the screen is composed of accidental effects due to the overlap of physical properties and media. As these characteristics are applied to the work, the paint is pushed and pulled within the canvas, and this gravity creates a trajectory of density and speed on the screen. This creates a natural blank space on the screen, and it can be seen that artist Yeonhee Kim has evolved this phenomenon with her unique color technique. Artist Kim Yeon-hee creates her own world of work with her own will and her overflowing vitality, and gives meaning and beauty to it. In the 2022 Accept exhibition by artist Kim Yeon-hee, who was invited to the Schema Museum of Art, where the simplest composition of color, plane, and line brings great resonance in different blank spaces, you can appreciate about 30 recent works from 2016.",

Everyday sounds made from everyday items, sounds of fusion made from various materials, sounds of regeneration given new uses, sounds of resurrection from objects that have been used, and sounds of vibration caused by tremors, all these echoing sounds are happiness.

                explanation: "This project, ‘SM Smash’, is a work that becomes the cornerstone of moving the Shema Museum of Art’s planning and artist perspective beyond regional limitations to the global stage. It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store format platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that spread out into the world. Three events are scheduled to be held in the ‘Schema art museum – SM Smash’ space. 1. SM-Smash#1, which studies digital painting and digital sculpture, 2. SM-Smash#2, a participatory project and performance space, 3. SM-Smash#3, which expands networks through archiving and events. Among the three events, ' 'SM-Smash#1: Data Material' is the first exhibition of SM Smash and aims to introduce painting and sculpture artists whose works have data as a physical property and are researching a form optimized for the metaverse and organize the exhibition. I think that works that utilize the characteristics of data as a material for art or remake it as a data material in a form that suits the purpose of the work are a big environmental change and hot topic for contemporary artists. We would like to introduce the works of these leading artists on a metaverse platform that actively promotes illusion.",

Just as the surrealism we know in art history is the exact opposite of the reproduction or fantasy of an ideal state that transcends reality, Seunghoon Lee's display transforms a digital illusion that is smoother than reality into a creaky and bumpy medium. His animated paintings betray the smooth and illusory images that one usually expects from digital displays, more realistic than reality, boasting ‘naturalness’ and ‘animated’ images that come to life.",

                explanation: "Schema Museum of Art is preparing for artist Seongmi Kim’s 12th solo exhibition ‘Afterimage of the Forest’ during this hot summer. ‘Forest’, which is the motif of the artist’s work, symbolizes ‘vitality and healing’ in life. The forest, which is both the home of human life and a resting place, serves as an inspiration from nature to the author. For artist Kim Seong-mi, ‘forest’ goes beyond a visual ‘forest’ and warns of the secrets and records it holds, and that humanity will inevitably destroy and become distant from nature as it develops into a new civilization and creates a new history. In this exhibition, various unexpected social and natural problems are presented through blue abstract flat work and video work. For the artist, the forest is a being that faces the external world as a life, and the yearning, longing, and regret for nature that the writer feels are related to the subtle world. The traces left as the colors are layered several times, the paint is absorbed, and it dries are the artist's expressions. We will present an abstract painting that shows the interaction of worldviews. In this exhibition, the artist has continued to use the forest as a motif in recent years to capture all the changes over time. Just like our lives, it will be an exhibition that accepts the changes of time and appreciates the ‘forest’ as seen by the artist through metaphorical expressions that reflect the artist’s personal life. We hope that this will be an opportunity to find ‘life with nature’ through the implementation of changes in time and traces that extend beyond the canvas plane to digital work.",

                explanation: "Human ancestors flattened stone walls and painted hunting prayers on them. The plane created by mankind itself became a groundbreaking means of evolution, and within the plane mankind was able to imagine new metaphysics, language, and images. This flatness lies in the background of the birth of art. The flat surface created by breaking and grinding the stone wall has now become a smooth monitor made with rare earth elements as the basic raw material through soil and wood. It can also be said that the history of mankind is viewed depending on the sensitivity of the smoothness of the planes created by humans. How is the material world and the world of metaphysics related to [smoothness - the density of particles], and what influence will this have on modern art? Also, modern art artists are still part of the material world in the generation that has the smoothest plane in human history. This exhibition was planned to examine how they exist and how they interact and work. Perhaps we understand the material particles symbolized by stones and the world of metaphysics and imagination derived from them in the most dense form? think. Artist Kim Yun-seop collects images from the flood of images, archives them day by day, and combines the contemporary art of the day on canvas to create the [Today's Contemporary Art Series]. He appropriates the images of modern art consumed through screens rather than materials to create new screen compositions and implements them in a pictorial way. Artist Byung-ho Lee is the only artist who works in three dimensions, and as a tool to create new sculptures, he first sketches using a 3D program. The sketched three-dimensional polygon is transferred back to the material, divided, and each part is reassembled and manufactured with different materials. He actively accepts the collisions and contrasts of materials that occur in this process and creates sculptures with new formative features. I think that author Cho Min-seon is the author who can most closely show the world of metaphysical imagination. Through his work, the author captures the ambivalence of humans who are interdependent but also constantly form relationships as independent entities. Various situations and complex emotions resulting from relationships are visualized using various media such as installation, video, and interactive. It is mainly shown as interactive installation work using technologies such as programming and video mapping, and also shows work incorporating photography or painting, and is also shown as a form of work that returns from data to material work. In this way, modern artists basically use both smooth and rough stone fields at the same time and produce their works again using the body represented by material. It is time to open our eyes to what significance this method has for us and how it will change in the future.",

This way of working is performed not as a completion, but as an attempt to celebrate the drawing process and stay in it as much as possible. ‘Light Seekers’ appear in Ted Chiang’s short story ‘Hell is the Absence of God’. They are pilgrims who chase the light of heaven to enter heaven in the novel's worldview where the light descends. They may be injured or die during the pilgrimage, and may be blinded by the heavenly light they believe to be salvation or fall into hell. What is faith? In the eyes of reason, the Light Seekers are foolish gamblers, but they are existential in that they act even at the risk of their own death. I feel that there is no much difference between me, who continues to paint while anticipating failure, and the light seekers who pursue the heavenly light. But unlike me, Light Seekers do not doubt salvation. Through the belief that they can enter heaven by touching the light and the existential practice that follows, they may already be saved people who feel God and live this life in hope. I don't yet know the shape of my finished painting, but I always work as if I'm praying, aiming to reach it. It's not pessimistic. However, I try to stay in the drawing process as long as possible and try to delay that ecstatic moment of salvation, which may only happen once, as much as possible.",

I unfolded the canvas and completed the painting by selecting images one by one, stacking them and filling them. Figures drawn in parts sequentially have their own flow of light and different viewpoints, so they are together but have different spatial characteristics, and they are contrasted with flat planes and three-dimensional surfaces, and planes and lines, creating a surreal composition that is connected together in the space of the painting. have it I believe that painting is the face that reflects our contemporary times. What kind of face will my contemporary image have? The image was approached with the question, and ironically, the moment the painting was drawn, it became a face of the past, becoming today's contemporary art series.",

This is to overcome the solid form and surface determined at the completion stage of the work, and shows a working attitude to present sculpture in a state of continuous flux and transformation. The materials of the work, unitized through copying, become new originals through transformation, disassembly, and recombination. Sculptures produced/derived during the work process may become independent works in themselves, or may be used as materials or objects to be reborn as another sculpture each time a new project is undertaken. This work journey takes place not only in physical space but also in virtual space through 3D scan data. The work presented before ‘Smooth Stone Field’ at the Schema Museum of Art is the ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series. The ‘Eccentric Abattis’ series is based on the methodology of Auguste Rodin, a sculptor from the late 19th century. Rodin enjoyed marcottage work, which involves recombining existing works and presenting them as new works, and in the process of this work, unused by-products were created, which Rodin called ‘abattis.’ The 'Eccentric Abattis' series allows us to accept (Rodin's) Abatti, which was left behind after its usefulness was exhausted, from a work object to a subject, and further subdivides the Abatti whose shape remains to the point where its shape has ambiguity, and then reuses it as a formative material. It is a series of combinations.",

This is visualized not only through video work, but also through various media installation methods using various objects and sensors. In this exhibition, the works <reflection, 2021> and <fragility, 2020> are combined into one to present a work with a new meaning. Specifically, it is the work of thinking about the various changing relationships in modern society and guiding the viewer into the work to form a new relationship between them and the work or to reinterpret it. Several beam projectors installed on the ceiling of the exhibition hall project toward the floor. Geometrically shaped fragments are constantly floating and change their appearance according to the data values ​​of the sensor. Additionally, there are broken pieces of mirror installed on the wall. A broken piece of mirror distorts and reflects light in space differently depending on the degree and direction of its surface. The three-dimensional and unrealistic effect created by dozens of mirror sculptures transports you to a utopian place that does not belong to any space and a Uchronian time that does not exist in reality. The mirror used as a medium is an intermediate device that reflects our appearance in reality while escaping the actualized space and inducing an experience in another dimension. Mirrors broken into different shapes trap viewers within small pieces and provide an opportunity to view themselves as different objects. And the fragmentary images reflected through the mirror constitute a dreamlike, neutral world that cannot be experienced in reality.",

It is true that local art museums have geographical limitations and major restrictions on cultural and artistic activities centered on the metropolitan area. Physical - In addition to offline planning, the Schema Museum of Art's concept space was established in the Metaverse, a new blockchain continent that suddenly emerged online, exposing the Schema Museum's experimental plans to the Metaverse space and introducing contemporary artists encompassing the region and the center. I'm going to do it. The SM Smash chain store-type platform aims to become the NFT headquarters of the Schema Museum of Art and branch out, just as McDonald's became a fast food restaurant that expanded into the world. SM-Smash, the online metaverse branch of the Schema Museum of Art, is holding its second exhibition after <Data Meterial>, the first exhibition that tested the possibilities of digital media. The second exhibition, <Wa are Happening>, presents an experimental exhibition in the field of performance using the Metaverse platform. Audiences enter a new world of play through Decentraland, the world's largest metaverse platform. This type of exhibition, which involves visiting the SM-Smash box office located in Decentraland (57,-83) and entering Metaberry, a new metaverse space, is the first inter-metaverse mobile exhibition in Korea and an expansion of the metaverse platform. It shows the possibility of a new form of dramatic art through the possibility of and network. Director Song Joo-ho of Diorama Vivant Theater, who was invited for this exhibition, designs and experiments with expanded forms of plays based on his unique analog sensibility. The audience will pass through the box office and enter the theater to experience a new play that stands at the forefront of modern art.",

                        text: "– Synopsis: Six actors stand on a stage simulating an excavation site. As they excavate the remains of characters who have already died and been buried in the ground, they reproduce the forgotten expressions and lost voices of the dead. – Description of work: <History / Hysterie> consists of two-dimensional videos of six actors imagining a “lost narrative” excavating remains or giving a monologue. In this work, the theme of ‘loss’ is externalized in the form of ‘footage’ referring to “lost data.” Between the way the fragmented and scattered footage is displayed in the Metaverse Theater and the way it is viewed, the audience, who have become performers and avatars, attempt to approach the “completed or already dead” original from their own perspective, the lost narrative. Various editions will be 'played' in . This landscape of restoration seeks to witness the kind of neurosis suffered as the history of a real work is transferred to the virtual world as an “avatar of the work.” History may also be a performance of neurosis. - Production intention: The impossibility of eternity, a characteristic of a play that cannot maintain a specific state between a one-time live performance and multiple reenactments, is itself a mythical act and a way of existence that resists “completion or death.” Although a play cannot reproduce death, it manages to reenact it, exploring or staying at the edge of the myth. Sometimes, when it wants to penetrate into the inside of the myth, it creates a narrative-story that it has never experienced, revealing its desire and being consumed by it. Perhaps because desire cannot reproduce death, it is better resisted through theater. Meanwhile, ‘Diorama Vibang Theater’ creates plays based on the aesthetic ethics of the irreverence of art called ‘incompleteness’, which is revealed in the characteristic of the impossibility of eternity in plays. The incompleteness referred to here does not refer to “an unfinished story,” but to “not resisting death.” Then, suddenly, I think of a play that can only be recreated by taking advantage of the characteristics of film, which can permanently fix the finished result.",

                explanation: "Artist Koo Ja-soong (1941~, Western painter) is a first-generation Korean hyperrealist artist who shows restrained still life paintings through the private space of an Eastern worldview. Artist Koo Ja-seung was born in 1941 and graduated from the Department of Painting and the Graduate School of Education at Hongik University College of Fine Arts. Starting with his first solo exhibition at Sun Gallery in 1978, he has been engaged in endless artistic activities for 44 years. Artist Jang Ji-won (1946~, Western painter) uses flowers, birds, and trees as a metaphor for nature hidden in his mind, and still creates his work through a fierce battle with himself to create his imaginary world. Artists Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won began working in Chungju in 1986 when they moved their studio to the banks of the Namhan River in Chungju. After retiring from Sangmyung University, artist Koo Ja-seung built his current studio in 2007 and continues to work in North Chungcheong Province. This exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won at the Schema Art Museum is an exhibition with a special synergy as they are a local senior artist and a married couple. It can be said that the two artists left a significant mark on the Korean art world as colleagues who communicated and stimulated each other. Although the painting styles of the two couples are different, the subject matter of their works, flowers, is something they have in common. In the fierce world of artists, the two couples have supported and supported each other for half their lives, building and expanding their own unique world of work with the beauty of new formative interpretations, the space of Eastern thought, and an Oriental perspective. Artist Koo Ja-seung paints still life paintings that are close to hyper-realism, and ordinary motifs such as glasses, liquor bottles, vases, flowers, and chests become the main characters of artist Koo Ja-seung's paintings. These objects harmonize with each encounter through their delicacy and light reflection effect, and rather than intentionally crowding many objects into the center of the canvas and reproducing or moving them, they show the restrained flow of time. In the artist's understated still life paintings, we can get a glimpse into the artist's intense mental world beyond beauty. Artist Jang Ji-won shows the hidden dimensions of nature through his own imaginative landscapes. Materials such as flowers, birds, and trees that appear in the artist's work are created using Korean paper as a basic work, repeatedly cutting and pasting, painting, scraping, and attaching Korean paper again to create the desired shape with a thick matiere effect, and acrylic, oil, and other materials such as flowers, birds, and trees appear in the artist's work. It is expressed freely using various materials such as pastel and colored pencil. The author looks into the essence of humans in nature and shows a world of healing and happiness, comfort and peace. This invitational couple exhibition by Koo Ja-seung and Jang Ji-won, held at the Schema Museum of Art, is an exhibition in which the 44-year-long world of works by Koo Ja-seung, a master of realism in North Chungcheong Province, and the 40-year-long world of artist Jang Ji-won's works face each other. The world of work by two senior couple artists who supported and communicated with each other for half their lives will be exhibited at the Schema Art Museum on October 14-11. You can enjoy it until the 13th. Through 'Breathing Still Life' by Koo Ja-seung, who maintains his unshakable position as the best artist of Korean realism, and 'Hidden 次元' by Jang Ji-won, who shows another world of still life painting that shows the imaginative landscape of nature with warm materials, This exhibition will explore the aesthetic formativeness and mental expression of previous realism and immerse yourself in the charm of original and beautiful still life paintings.",

We plan to design this space as a space where one can view catalogs, publications, and artists' portfolios made during the course of exhibition activities. People will be able to enter the link for each space, and artists will be able to share ideas here and interact with artists from around the world within the metaverse. Our goal is to showcase the works of young Korean artists to the world through SM-Smash#3 space and to help them create their own metaverse studio spaces, making it an art street. By helping and exchanging information and creating metaverse studios for various Korean artists, I hope that this will become a place for information exchange similar to real estate. In addition, we plan to expand participation through publicity by creating various art experience events and giving people from all over the world the opportunity to experience Korean art.

' This is a results report exhibition that reports on the progress and process in the form of an archive and exhibition.

                explanation: "The artists participating in the 2022 ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition are those who have just graduated or are new artists about to make a new start. The Schema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists and encourage the passion of new artists for their work in order to continuously establish a balance in local art every year. This exhibition supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition, and hopes to create new challenges and opportunities for local young artists and create an art ecosystem in our region. The ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition will be held in two parts, the ‘Unstable Possibilities 1’ exhibition will feature artists Ki-tae Kim, Byeol Son, Seung-won Yoon, Sang-hee Jeon, and Gyu-bong Choi, and the ‘Unstable Possibilities 2’ exhibition will feature artists Jun-hu Kim, Yu-seung Lee, Jun-woo Lee, Yun-hee Jang, and Chi-hoon Jeon. A total of ten artists participate. In particular, as Unstable Possibility implies, writers are unstable but contain infinite possibilities. Artists visualize unstable reason and their own perception of the world in a variety of ways, and express in their works everything from the stories of individuals living their daily lives to the world we live in and their thoughts about art. These thoughts and concerns are unstable, but they are creating a new world. Artist Kim Ki-tae, who is participating in the first exhibition of Unstable Possibilities, says he wants to find a life that flows naturally. I try to find such questions through ‘Cactus’. To the author, cacti provide comfort, but at the same time, the numerous thorns are also a personal pain and the pain and suffering experienced while searching for life.",

It serves as a platform to check the flow of world contemporary art by providing information on new contemporary art and planning creative exhibitions. I want to do it. In that sense, every year, the Shema Museum participates in various international events planned, selects representative artists who have been most active internationally, and awards plaques and prize money.

He is very active not only in China but also around the world, including in the US, UK, and Korea, with drawings, objects, installations, and performances. His work 'Unity of Heaven and Man' performance, 'Northern Romanticism' production, 'Gihwaseungcho (奇花昇草)' objet installation work, and drawing series are all indicative of his genius as an artist. These works are sufficient to show the appearance of . After a chance meeting with Kim Jae-kwan, director of the Shema Art Museum, in 2009, he held the “不期而遇” exhibition <Beijing Amnesty Gallery, 2010>, “和異不同” exhibition <Cheongju Shema Art Museum, 2011>, and “Inherent and Unborn” exhibition <Beijing Amnesty Gallery, 2010>. We participated in several special exhibitions together, including Space Gallery, 2012, and exchanged between Beijing and Cheongju. In particular, he was selected as an artist representing China and participated in the four-country international exchange exhibition “Memory and Imagination as New Art,” held as a special exhibition at the Shema Art Museum in 2017. Cang The relationship between the two artists extends beyond their works and extends to a spiritual connection between them, and they are firmly maintaining their own identities. In this invitational exhibition, you can enjoy a total of 13 works by artist Chang Shin, ranging from his 2003 work to his performance video from 2020. Unfortunately, it is very unfortunate that author Chang Shin cannot attend this meaningful event due to the ‘COVID-19’ pandemic. However, we have hope and expectation that we will be able to meet again soon.",

New shamanism includes animism among shamanistic worship in cold regions, dualism of ancient Persian Zoroastrianism, Babylonian astrology, Hinduism's theory of reincarnation, compassion for animals among Indian Jainism, practice of arc-shaped circling among Islamic Sufis, Gnostic theism, and wisdom of Jewish Kabbalah. The spiritual practices of life at the time were explored, including trees, the I Ching numeral ruler, Taoist cultivation techniques, Western alchemy, the mystical teachings of Hermes, the Pythagorean school of numbers, and the “new era” spiritual training movement that emerged in the West after World War II. It is integrated. Science promotes contemporary humanity to develop nature and present cutting-edge theories and achievements through logical reasoning and empirical methods. For example, cyborgs, blockchain, Internet of Things, brain science, digital currency, algorithmic life, new media art, bio-genetic engineering, space travel, nanotechnology, quantum physics, human immortality, emergence of singularity, etc. are related to the philosophy of science religion and technology. In the background, traditional lifestyles and the appearance of the Earth are changing dramatically. In conclusion, we aim to subjectively build a systematic artistic language system through the two lines of “New Shamanism” and “Cutting-edge Achievements of Science.”",

                explanation: "Beyond Lotus: The Shema Museum of Art's first special invitation exhibition in 2021, 'Indrayala: Lotus' by artist Jaeboon Shim, features 64 'lotus' photographic works taken by the artist from 2018 to recent times. This is an exhibition presented. In modern art, photography goes beyond the basic properties of ‘recording and reproduction’ to enable individual expression, and the possibilities for expression are diversifying and expanding depending on how the artist selects and views the subject. By capturing 'lotus flowers' with his camera, artist Shim Jae-bun has expanded his realm of expression to the world of unconsciousness and imagination deep inside the artist, and has spent several years trying to find the inner expression of the object called 'lotus flower' rather than simply reproducing it. By recording it, it is leading to the practice of going into the spiritual world of enlightenment. The exhibition title, Indrjala, fully embodies the artist's thoughts. Indrjala is said to mean Indra's net in Sanskrit. According to ancient Indian mythology, it covers the sky above the Foresight City, where the god Indra lives, and is said to be a kind of weapon, with precious beads embedded in each net, and the lights coming from it overlap countless times, creating a mysterious world. In Buddhism, it is used to mean the world of dharma that is constantly connected to each other and spreads throughout the world, and Indramang is also a Buddhist perspective on the world. In the ‘Indriyala: Lotus’ exhibition, artist Shim Jae-bun goes beyond the subject of ‘lotus’ and looks at the human world through the artist’s own Indra network. Although we seem to live alone, in reality we are connected to each other, and we use 'ultra-telephoto lenses' and 'ultra-wide-angle lenses' to recreate our existence in a close relationship where we reflect on each other and further extend to relationships with the world and humans. By using this, the surreal reality felt by capturing the nature that the eye cannot see in a single image is turned into a work of art and another image is reproduced. In this exhibition, he penetrated the essence of the object and recreated it in his own language, including 'primitive innocence', 'purification of purity', 'shadow of existence', 'corruption of obsession', 'shape of haggard agony', and 'balance and shape'. The exhibition will feature works from the series ‘In Search’ and ‘Sublimation of the Free Spirit’ as well as the installation work ‘Chaos’.",

When I see lotus flowers, my thoughts go not only to the record of their name, but also to the small sound they make as they are shaken by the wind. Lotus flowers grown by water, air, wind, and soil... It is a universal idea that combines the underworld, earth, and sky, symbolizing fertility as the source of life, and sought to find the link between rebirth in paradise, reincarnation, and fate in the four seasons of the lotus. Whether it is a dark night or a foggy lotus field, with persistent vitality and wisdom, it is not stained by dirt even in dirty mud, is not bewitched even when rising above the shaking water, and blooms and bears fruit at the same time, showing cause and effect at the same time and creating a cause. He was already telling the truth that the results were also there. By taking as the photographic subject another link of an inherent relationship that could not be felt in its actual form, the process is direct and abstract, indirect, indirect and implicit, changing, adding or removing saturation or light color from the visible reality. I tried to prevent the sublimation of a free spirit by looking into the starting point of the relationship. I was able to get a little closer to the truth that not everything that is visible is everything, but even everything that is invisible is the truth.",

The Shema Museum of Art is attempting to replace the studio as a place that combines the inside and outside of the Shema Museum with an art museum. Schema Art Museum, located in the beautiful countryside of Naesu, Cheongju, is a venue equipped with both an outdoor space and a white cube, and is offering a studio-exhibition space to five artists. Artists feel inspiration for their works from inside or outside, on the walls or outdoors, and proceed with their work here. This is an extension and replacement of the artist's personal ‘studio’, with the purpose of producing new works while feeling a different sense of place, and vividly recording and turning the site into a work of art. The 'STUDIO' exhibition is a place where artists produce, think, and move their work in Cheongju by providing a studio-exhibition hall at the Schema Art Museum, a place with both an outdoor space and a white cube located in the beautiful countryside of Naesu, Cheongju. We would like to feel the inspiration for the works of five artists inside and outside the Shema Museum, on the walls or outdoors, and proceed with their work here. The participating artists are five artists active in the Cheongju area: Hyunmook Kim, Nile Creven, Shin Yongjae, Seongu Lee, and Jaeyoung Choi. They serve as a medium connecting the inside and outside of the Schema Museum of Art, and the artists use the Schema Museum as a place and studio where new works are created. Additionally, this is an exhibition that is occupied by the works created here. In particular, the five artists participating in this exhibition seek to communicate through contemporary discourse and multifaceted visual formative works by exploring the passion for their work, fresh ideas, their infinite potential, experiments and challenges that can be developed in the future, and the identity of their work. do. This ‘studio’ exhibition, planned by the Schema Museum of Art, seeks to become a medium for questioning the sense of place and serving as an experimental creative space in the expanding contemporary art. In modern art, ‘place’ has given us many meanings and given us new inspiration, and it is still ongoing. In the ‘studio’ exhibition, the image of a place is its identity, and is created individually, collectively, and socially. This exhibition, featuring young local artists Hyun-mook Kim, Nile Creven, Shin Yong-jae, Seon-gu Lee, and Jae-young Choi, who are creating and searching for their own 'identity', is an organic relationship between White Cube and the outside world by giving the artists a new space called the Schema Art Museum. This is an exhibition in which the artists encounter different memories and inspirations in an environment that is embodied in various media, including paintings and installations. Artists explore their passion for work, fresh ideas, their infinite potential, experiments and challenges that can develop in the future, and the identity of their work. Contemporary discourse and the exhibition of multifaceted visual formative works lay a new foundation for local contemporary art. I expect that it will be done.",

Recently, I have been drawing works about the impact of the surrounding environment on people at a sensory and emotional level. We plan to continue this exploration next year. The most recent works deal with much more personal topics. I draw inspiration from my body and environment to create works that reveal my own insecurities, obsessions and moods. The studio is a safe place where you can freely explore personal topics. Taking work out of the studio and exhibiting it is an act based on trust. Because I create and exhibit more personal work, the act of exhibiting has a deeper meaning. What I want to explore in this exhibition is the entire process of bringing work out of the studio for the artist and the audience. The works that remain in the studio can be considered failures. Or maybe it's something so personal that you don't want to display it. However, among my works, these works may leave a stronger impression than the works I usually display to show to others. Past work often did not deal with personal topics, but rather attempted to take a more universal approach to the subject. In the future, I plan to try to give more personal and personal meaning to my work.",

                        text: "Go up to the rooftop and look at the sky that day. He examines with his eyes the image of a space that seems far from reality, and changes that are not static are expressed through feelings that occur in the moment. The color of the sky changes all the time, and the shapes of the clouds are also irregular. An unpredictable attitude brings tension, comfort, and excitement. People have lived together with nature, but their roles seem to be different. The appearances and feelings of nature are different at every moment, and the colors cannot be the same even when drawn. Changes that never stop make us feel the passage of time. The more you focus on looking at the sky, the calmer it becomes. The noises of life subside to the point where you can't believe your ears, and only the temperature, smells, the strength of the wind, and the sounds of nature embrace your body. At these moments, like a scene you may have seen in a movie or drama, you stand still and the surroundings keep changing. When you look at it, the time given by nature is sometimes slow and sometimes fast. When drawing while looking at the sky, natural brush strokes are created through unclear thoughts conveyed through the senses of the body rather than through precise shapes. Leave the brush strokes to your senses. My mood is controlled by these things and I feel like I am being absorbed into what I am looking at. As I looked at the dawn, the energy of morning, the glare at noon, the silent change at sunset, and the night when the light disappeared, I saw days that were neither regular nor the same. Compared to people, each day repeats itself, but today and tomorrow are different lives. Each day is set in time, but this is also based on the flow of nature, and each person has small changes in the day. That's how each day passes by. It seems that as such days accumulate, a person's life is created and the valuable word 'lived' is used. I feel like living means continuing to walk through that endless, empty space. On a day without a single cloud, a corner of my heart feels depressed when I look at that endless place. Just as memories deteriorate and become dull over time, the act of continuing to look at the sky and draw is a natural part of one's daily routine. It's raining. What you sense are a cloudy sky, generally dark light, a damp coolness, and the sound of rain. The feelings that arise in this atmosphere give rise to emotions. There are times when it becomes unpleasant or depressing, but there are also times when it is charming. The parts where I paint in the rain are different movements from the paintings I did before. I have unexpected fun when those marks on the canvas become tangled or erased by rainwater. The state in which emotions arise on a rainy day is like seeing changes while drawing. I have no choice but to accept the falling rain. I saw the sky by chance every day. There must have been emotional turmoil in painting the sky. The feeling that it was beautiful and that it was no different came from seeing the coincidental appearance of the sky. Rather than wondering how they came into being, I compared the emotions that I empathize with based on everyday life to the sky. And when I engage in the act of drawing, I feel the freedom of escaping from the hustle and bustle of life.",

However, behind this place of tranquility, there is an implicit condition, ‘within space’, as if it were a betrayal. Some people think that these trading conditions are natural. However, on the contrary, it may be that we have become insensitive due to the numerous senses repeated over a long period of time, or that 'tranquility' represents the standardized social frame created within the category of 'rational' from the hunting era through the modernist era to modern society. I wonder if it was packaged in packaging and was continuously having an impact. Perhaps the current space appears to me as a beautifully packaged heterotopia. There are several situations that underlie this idea. The first is the 'anxiety' that appears in the social position of the artist as the head of the household. Of course, physical space and 'anxiety' feel like disparate things, but many people use the term 'home' to recognize space as a place to relieve 'anxiety'. However, it can be said that the starting point of the artist's work was that he did not feel that the place called 'home' was a place to resolve 'anxiety'. And secondly, there is habit. When a writer is involved in a certain location, I always start researching that place as a habit. Everything that makes up the place is checked, from the overall structure of the place in large detail to the number of windows, the structure of the ceiling and roof, the beams of the walls, and the materials. I don't know when this habit started, but it seems like it's been around for a long time. Let's look at the spaces that come into contact with me due to the complex effects of these situations. And the result of the experiment using all the elements that appear in that space is my work.",

                explanation: "Cho Hyun-ae Painting: Construction of space and time in the virtual world: How are new thoughts created? For artists who have to conceive of a new work, go through the working process, and complete the work, they never stop worrying about new thoughts and work, because the blank canvas is another world facing the real world. Therefore, conceptual artist Lee Woo-hwan defined the moment a brushstroke is made on a white canvas as the moment when the real world and another world meet for the first time. Perhaps because such philosophical ideas are the basis, most of the titles of artist Lee Uhwan's works are ‘meeting’ or ‘encounter.’ In the book <Space Created by Space>, architect Yoo Hyeon-jun says, “Empty space exists before light. “On the dark earth God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” There is a phrase that says. In the English Bible, ‘empty’ is written as ‘Void.’ In the early days of civilized society, when there was little scientific thinking, it was thought that when God created the world, he first created ‘empty space’, ‘void space’, and then ‘light’. This means that even light cannot exist without empty space. Einstein, a genius physicist, does not recognize ‘empty space’ in the ‘principle of relativity’ he discovered. The reason is that he defined ‘empty space’ (air) as a substance. Likewise, in modern art, Picasso's 'Cubism' deconstructed perspective, rejected naturalistic light and shade, and eliminated illusionary space, so there is no empty space in Cubist works. This is what the author said about the work at the Grimson Gallery solo exhibition in 2015. First, the author must have his or her own creative image. Second, the content of the picture does not necessarily have to be descriptive. It must be able to trigger imagination, whether it is non-objective, non-representational, or non-representational. Third, it must be metaphorical. A metaphor in a work must have a connection, whether verbal or visual. These three characteristics still apply equally today. In the end, we can see that Cho Hyun-ae's new paintings use new materials while recovering images from flat paintings that were premised on the dissolution of images, and her interest changed to the problem of composing and expressing new spaces and times. Visual metaphors are created on a two-dimensional plane and associations contained within the metaphors are created. Since the images that appear here are simultaneously reproduced in screen space across time, they can be described as a feature of 'composition of space and time'. same. Characteristics of post-postmodernism include the most complex style with a pluralistic structure, accepting sensibility as an important expressiveness. The characteristics of the complex style of the pluralistic structure try to match the ideas, situations, and experiences described by analogy, metaphor, symbol, and allegory. This emerges from the recognition of new meanings and values, expressing ecological sensibility, paying attention to future problems, breaking away from Modernist's dry style, and transitioning to a free method. I think that these elements, whether it is the problem of ‘empty space’ or the problem of ‘sensibility’, act as major elements that form Cho Hyun-ae’s work. Paul Klee said, “Art is not a reproduction of what is visible; it is a means of making visible what is invisible.” Ultimately, as Klee said, painting is about reproducing the invisible world. And it is clear that the reproduced image is ‘not’ real, no matter how identical it is. Cho Hyun-ae’s world of work brings to mind ‘René Magritte’ and ‘Chagall’ as exemplary artists. In terms of representation, Chagall's world of work is surrealistic, an exploration of the existence and reality of objects, a problem of the visible and the invisible, a problem of reality and illusion, that is, a problem of vision and perception. Magritte's world of work can be defined as a matter of 'words and images'. ‘Words and images’ can replace words in description, and sometimes they can accurately refer to names written in paintings, or they can be ambiguous, and in some cases, they can have an ironic metaphor. For this reason, Magritte is evaluated as the artist who first presented the issues of ‘image’, ‘water’, and ‘language’ in painting. A characteristic of Cho Hyun-ae’s work is that she first establishes an ‘empty space’ on the screen in which to place an image. Next, like Magritte, he seems to be thinking about how to compose ‘image’, ‘water’, and ‘language’. It can be seen that interest is changing from the two-dimensional paintings that most of the works until recently were based on the premise of the deconstruction of the image to the problem of merging new materials and composing new space and time while recovering the image. By not only creating visual metaphors on a two-dimensional plane and creating associations contained in metaphors, but also merging 'objects', 'images', 'water', and 'language' are simultaneously reproduced in screen space beyond time, creating a new world. I think it can be explained by the characteristic of ‘composition of space and time’. As art historian Kit White said, “Images are abstract.” And “the image does not mean that it is the object that appears there. It is a conceptual or mechanical copy of an ‘object’ that was there before. It may seem obvious, but it is deeply related to the way we perceive ‘things’ and our attitude when using images. Since a painting is a symbolic convergence of various forms, it is always a ‘Metaphor’ whether it is conscious or not. It is the media of the symbolic language called metaphor, and it is the language of art.” Until about 10 years ago, Cho Hyun-ae's paintings remained in the category of modernist abstract art, but with her understanding of the flat surface and recognition of 'empty space', we can see that she has completely transformed into a new work after postmodernism. The 2015 Grimson Gallery solo exhibition and the 2020 Geumbosung Art Museum solo exhibition show continuous change and development. In particular, recent works are expected to expand in a more free way by spreading interest not only in the issues of space and time created by the combination of images and objects, but also in the expression of ecological sensibilities, which are increasingly important in contemporary art, and future issues. do.",

                        text: "The theme of my work is time. Just as life is a world of aporia with a distant horizon, time, the basis of life, is also distant. So time is not a simple flow or disappearance. Time is a place where the scenes of a long life are melted together. All memories, traces, dreams and expectations are lined up in layers. Time is thick. How do we measure the thickness of this time? My painting is a work of constructing space and time to create a visual metaphor on a two-dimensional plane and to express the associations contained in the metaphor in spatial and visual language. In the ambiguous boundary between reality and virtuality, the picture is completed by reproducing or transforming illusory images of the past, present, and future. The images that appear in the work maximize a surreal space that transcends time and space by arranging objects that existed in completely different spaces and times simultaneously or unrealistically, and also act as a metaphor for infinite space. Among the works of the last 2-3 years, there are works whose subject matter is a single large flower petal. The studio and surrounding environment have a great influence on the artist. Fortunately, my studio is located in the countryside, so I can come into close contact with all kinds of trees and flowers and really feel the change of seasons. Every year, one day, when I was captivated by the large and splendid appearance of the white peony flower, I waited for it to bloom all winter, and when I saw it wither and fall less than ten days after it bloomed, I felt sad and set one petal as a metaphor for time. It is also an expression of the loneliness that our lives are no different from our own lives as they bloom too briefly and then wither compared to the wait. In the first half of this year, I started a new work using wrapping cloth and shopping bags as a metaphor for time. In order to add a three-dimensional effect that was lacking in flat work, I created a shape canvas with birch wood and combined objects and neon to pursue layers of time in various ways. Shopping bags and wrapping cloths also have the symbolism of present and gift, so aren't they signifiers of love and desire that span the ages? Therefore, my work consists of a space with no boundaries between reality and virtuality, encompassing the past, present, and future, and an ambiguous flow of time between the past, present, and future.",

Each person lives his or her entire life in relationships that are deep or shallow, direct or indirect. Sometimes we form good relationships, but sometimes we get scratched by bad relationships and then form new relationships again. It's fate, fate, fate.",

The number of symptomatic patients in the country is increasing, and news from outside the country is also worrying. Most stores in town are closed and people are cautious about their movements. The once vibrant market is depressed by doubt and anxiety. Meanwhile, spring has come. As the busy world comes to a halt, the wind and air are clean and the sunlight is brilliant. Driven by desire, I finally became interested in my village and looked at it more closely. Eumseong-eup is a small, clean village surrounded by soft mountains on all sides and Sujeongcheon Stream flowing in the center of the city. The thick and cultivated Mt. Gaseop blocks the cold winds from the north, so Yongsan-ri, at the foot of the southern mountain, is filled with warm sunlight. The terrain is good for fruit farming, so the entire area is full of peach fields. Fruit trees planted at regular intervals spread out on the hill, and flower trees in full bloom swelled as if they were about to explode. The spring breeze blows the branches of the flower trees and the birds are also noisy. I visited the area several times to observe the shape and size of trees and measure flowering times. I decided to match it with the peach blossoms that open spring. I decided to dye a thin, long piece of fabric, make clothes with the same color, and wear it to become a giant flower. I sat under a tree full of peach blossoms and slowly opened the petals along with the flowers from dawn to midday. The flowers did not fully bloom until midday. However, the current situation dominated by Corona is unstable, like a work of art made by mistake by an inexperienced craftsman. I don't know when this will end. I wanted to find comfort and strength in a more complete place. I tried to fit myself into the cycle of nature and match the energy of spring through Permanence, ‘I Am Here Now 5, At Yongsan-ri Orchard’.",

Just as humans lost their lives, humans continue to look into the mirror of nature (the “material universe”) and see themselves as the reflection they see, a body without intelligence (senseless clay). Narcissus's dream, which is accepted as his true self and ultimately unable to use his physical life as an opportunity to develop his invisible, immortal self, is expressed through the metaphor of a forest - Narcissus' fantastic dreams and self that are constantly reminded in reality. The dream of centralism expresses dense trees and disappearing into a lake or forest as if passing by.",

The image of the darkness with the moon floating on it and the moment below it overlapping and playing over and over again permeates the screen as a single scene. On that day with a gentle wind blowing, another afterimage is engraved in my mind under the moon.",

It will be seen by you.” (Revelation 4:1) As I read the Book of Revelation, written by Apostle John while he was imprisoned on the island of Patmos, I wanted to picture a scene with an open door in heaven. The Bible depicts a scene in which a door opens in heaven and the throne of God unfolds. I also pictured two people floating up to see an open door in a blue sky with clouds, something I see every day. <Our Song>, 73 (Psalm 103:5) We read David's poem and reinterpreted it in light of our modern lives. Even though what we had hoped for did not turn out as we had hoped, we expressed our feelings by being satisfied with what was already good and continuing to sing.",

The work called <mowing> began because I was interested in the way the states before and after the grass was cleaned coexisted at the boundary during the mowing process. We also wanted to visually express the harmony of three dimensions, planes, and lines seen within it. The <fitting in> series is reminiscent of a scene where a leaf-shaped piece of grass lands and sits on an empty spot in the grass. As the title shows, I wanted to convey that every living thing has a given place that needs it. In other words, they are beings that are organically connected to each other.",

                        text: "When we look up at the sky, there are countless colors and shapes. When the wind comes and goes and caresses me, I lift my head and feel the change of seasons. What I express with color and shape is every moment and every moment, and these are ‘interlaced scenes.’ The world has recently become more connected virtually through the internet and social media platforms. These sites are overloaded with too much spontaneous content for users and don't give us enough time to check what we're consuming. Unable to connect in this impersonal way, I find myself more alone than ever. My works are the pinnacle of myself, expressed through countless layers of shade on countless canvases, and the unexpected ‘scenes’ revealed through these works. These characteristics are constantly mixed and reorganized, ultimately creating other abstract ‘scenes’ of mine. Wherever we are, our skies are connected. As I look to the sky, I seek human connection with others through the nature around me. At that time, I realized that my ‘scene’ was right where I was. The world changed dramatically in 2020. I knew I was more alone than ever before. Our interactions moved online, and we spent a lot of time staring at various machine screens. We are overwhelmed by an absurd amount of information everywhere, both true and fake. I was not conscious of the ‘scene’, hesitated in my studio, and put down my brush. Instead, I revisited ‘scenes’ from the past, virtually. On an online map, I tracked where I had been, the cities and countries I visited, the places my friends and I gathered, and the ‘scenes’ in which I lived. I traveled all over the map to remember where my ‘scenes’ were. Feelings of air, sky, seasonal changes, and ‘scenes’ of various places are realized through colors and shapes without clear exposure to specific places or times. In the winter of 2020, I finally regained the strength and will to pick up a brush again. My works are often conceived in small towns rather than cities or tourist destinations. What allows me to create again is specifically the desire to recreate this place on canvas. These shapes were formed using a map of the location as a guide. The colors were created from inspiration and memories of the place. Instead of tracing an actual map, these shapes and colors were drawn simply and freely on a canvas. This ‘Academy Street’ is the same scene I encountered every day when I attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany. What I was there at that time became a layer of color and shape to be added to my ‘scenes’ later.",

She was afraid of revealing her inner self and intentions to others, and naturally learned a skill called ‘hypocrisy’ to communicate well. He was in the conflict of having to ignore the suspicion of ‘hypocrisy’ that made him ambiguous and accept it as a necessary evil. This work constructs ‘pachinko’ as a symbol of human essential desire and expresses human ‘hypocritical behavior’.

Therefore, the “constancy of size” and “perception of color” felt through vision vary greatly. I am interested in the discrepancy and uncertainty of such people's perspectives, and I create a 'retinal vision' by deconstructing and reconstructing spatial composition and color hierarchies around 'perspective' and 'light,' which are the eternal themes of painting. We are seeking a space where “vision” and “perceptual vision” can become one. Due to the ambiguity of the boundary, I tried to express ourselves wandering and enjoying ourselves between virtual and real, subject and object. The dog that creates an optical illusion on the screen blurs the boundary between virtuality and reality, and expresses the appearance of a dog, the most familiar of humans and other animals, to make us feel different from ourselves and at the same time feel homogeneous.",

The skeins of silk thread from Korea and Japan were first unraveled and then tangled and twisted again. It reminds me of the discrimination I experienced in Japan after the war, as I was born and raised in Daejeon before the war and returned home after the war. It is a tangle of memories that cannot be easily resolved by people who lived their lives without being able to say that they were born in the Korean Peninsula. The Japanese people interviewed, with an average age of 80, must have been torn and torn between the national framework of “homeland” where they were born and raised and “Japan (people)” for 70 years. Also, looking at the colorful splendor of the intertwined “bundle of threads,” it reminds me of the intersection of the life trajectories of countless people who moved to, came to, and left the city of Daejeon. It is a metaphor for the complicated and entangled history of the two countries, and considering that Daejeon was a city created as a base for railroad construction, it also appears to be a desire swelled like an aneurysm of a railroad expanding along with the desire for imperialism. Where personal memory, national desire, and the multi-layered meanings and metaphors of micro/macro overlap and refuse to determine a narrow, univocal meaning, there is the potential for the “Chandelier” series to be attractive as a work of art. – Megumi Takashima (excerpt from the critique)",

As a material, paint is made up of pigment and adhesive, and past tempera paintings also completed the surface by adhering the paint to the screen. When everyday materials such as paper, cardboard, or cloth are composed on screen, expressions and rhythms that are completely different from before are created. Going beyond painting techniques, we are pursuing the possibility of “adhesion” in various senses of modern art more broadly.",

In doing so, she attempts to reconstruct concepts about the objects using only letters extracted from the words they contain. This series of works of art appeared in 2008 and has since expanded to name a variety of colors and shades thanks to the rich vocabulary of the Japanese language. Traditional Japanese color names tell us not only about where the raw materials come from, but also about Japan's art history. The color itself has its own history. In other words, it is the history of how color is connected to society, culture, and art. For artists, the names of colors also have meaning, because they symbolize the craft knowledge of human society. Because the names of colors are deeply rooted in their respective origins and uses, Nagashima feels that they are an essential element of artistic practice. Although Nagashima only used Japanese characters and Kanji when her Word-Graphy project began, she now uses a variety of languages. Her latest work is a series of portraits of people she meets by chance during her travels, and she uses the language of the people she met. Every country has its own color names and a history and culture based on traditional color names. She aims to demonstrate global diversity.",

                explanation: "This exhibition is organized by ‘Aspect Contemporary Art Association’, the most representative art group leading contemporary art in the Cheongju region. ‘Aspect’, a leading contemporary art group in Cheongju, was founded in 1988 by Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art, as its first president, and celebrates its 33rd anniversary this year. From 2000, the group name was changed to ‘Late Aspect’, making a developmental change to adapt to the postmodern era. And through exhibitions, seminars, and symposiums, it has served as a driving force to further accelerate the creativity of artists. Meanwhile, Chungcheongbuk-do's first international exchange exhibition, Aspect Coterie, began in 1991 with the “Korea-Japan New Generation Artists Exhibition” at the Seibu Museum of Art in Funabashi, Japan, and continued for 15 years with a second exhibition at the Cheongju National Museum the following year. Afterwards, exchange exhibitions between Cheongju and Tokyo, Funabashi, and Chiba continued, serving as a motif for the rapid development of Cheongju's contemporary art. In addition, Aspect established the ‘Chungbuk Youth Art Award’ and held it 10 times so far, focusing on nurturing young artists. The spirit of Aspect is a club composed of professional writers who pursue a creative spirit, transcending all differences in school, regionalism, and generation. How will this exhibition view and interpret future changes while overcoming the coronavirus pandemic? How will we respond to a changing future? This is a themed exhibition. In this exhibition, 12 artists including Jaegwan Kim, Youngran Kim, Eunsoo Lim, Jinmyeong Park, Baeksun Jang, Seongmi Kim, Kyunghwa Lee, Seungeon Oh, Ingyu Choi, Mingeon Choi, Jaebun Shim, and Roy Kim, who are members of the Later Aspects Contemporary Art Club, participate.",

The world of work, which started with grids and cubes, has gone through several stages of change and has recently expanded into the beauty of ‘distorted geometry’ and ‘multiple geometry’. The world of squares, which was the icon of the artist's abstract world, is deconstructed and freely expressed through new forms of 'rhythm' and 'color' of a more free geometric abstract world.",

                explanation: "The theme of the 2021 Cheongju Craft Biennale is “Tools for Conviviality.” It is said that this word was borrowed from Ivan Ilich's book <Tools of Autonomous Symbiosis>. The meaning of this year's theme is further explained as follows. “In an industrial society that has reached an irrecoverable state due to rapid growth over the past 200 years, individuals enjoy material abundance but have lost the confidence to overcome internal and external challenges, experiencing ‘modernized poverty’ and living in a standardized form of life. “We have been reduced to consumers of standardized products.” The Cheongju Craft Biennale mentions that it is a time when it is necessary to reflect on how contemporary crafts can deliver messages of healing and hope to people in a rapidly changed society amidst materialism, globalization, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In this way, the Cheongju Craft Biennale is conducting the biennale while thinking about how to create ‘tools for symbiosis’ for a ‘symbiotic society’ in the 21st century. In modern art, crafts and paintings show delicate differences in that they pursue the same and conflicting points. Paul Klee, a Spanish painter in the early 20th century, said, “Art is not a reproduction of the visible, but a making visible of the invisible.” He also said, “It is not that humans perceive color, but that color shakes the human heart.” If crafts started from use, painting started from emotional concepts, so they have very conflicting aesthetic values. As mentioned in the ‘Eco-Biennale Special Exhibition’ in 2013, the Korean Contemporary Art Contemporary Exhibition shows that the artists invited to this exhibition are senior artists in the Korean art world who are now following in the footsteps of artists in their 80s. Therefore, the same generation group is evaluated as a true elite group equipped with ‘inner reason’ at a turning point in Korean contemporary art. Therefore, I believe that the art historical evaluation of these generations will be subject to reevaluation and will become more important from now on. Twelve contemporary artists, including the late artists Lee Doo-sik, Hwang Chang-bae, and Kim Young-bae, as well as Kim Ryeong, Kim Jae-gwan, Kim Tae-ho, Shin Mun-yong, Ryu In-su, Jeon Yeon-il, Han Ki-ju, Han Man-young, and Hong Jae-yeon, have crossed the eight ridges of the Korean art world and reached the top. It can be said to be a valuable asset. Perhaps some artists have already reached the pinnacle of Korean painting. The “Special Exhibition of the Half Century of Korean Contemporary Art” held in conjunction with the “Art Bridge” project of the 12th Cheongju Craft Biennale Museum can be said to be a very valuable exhibition that enriches the autumn flower garden in Cheongju.",

                        text: "“I think art is a product of more human frustration.” He also said, “I believe that faith, skepticism, and humility can only be learned through the existence and experience of a difficult life. “Art is not only about what is visible in this world, but it also draws out the illusions in our thoughts, creates new images, and gives birth to ‘life’ with philosophical principles and concepts.” I want to say this. Geometry is not a visible entity, but an abstract entity. My world of work, which started with grids and cubes, has gone through several stages of change and has recently expanded into the beauty of ‘distorted geometry’ and ‘multiple geometry’. I want to dismantle the world of squares, which was the icon of my abstract world, and freely express myself with new forms of ‘rhythm’ and ‘color’ of a more free geometric abstract world. My world of work, which had evolved from the ‘Relationship Series’ era to the ‘Cube Series’ era since the late 70s, has changed again from the ‘Cube Series’ to the ‘Late Relationship Series’ since 2020. I would like to say that the meaning is not a return to the past, but the rediscovery of concepts and methods that were not completed in the past and the beginning of a new search. ※ The art of returning to nature is ‘necessarily’ aesthetic and formative. I start to think that it is not drawn according to principles and principles. I think that it is created by weaving the patterns of life in my mind with warp and weft, and I am putting 'light' into that space.",

In this process, you experience the Fantasia of life and begin a new day through this experience. This work projects human life onto flowers, which wither and wither in nature. However, the message in the work does not say that life, like flowers, is fleeting. Life is a concentric circle, made up of small grains of emotion. Therefore, it is expressed as each bead. Life is originally made up of elementary particles, and it contains the paradoxical meaning that it is nothing more than a small particle in the universe. The beginning of life, we wait with excitement. And flowering. Donga, a flower that blooms, experiences emotions such as inner pain, joy that can be healed, and shining hope at the same time. Additionally, flowers foretell fruition. The fruit abandons itself again and gains another life through sharing. If there is no pain and suffering, there is no inherent desire energy. The inner voice is always directed towards beauty and hope.",

Since the mid-1980s, pieces of panel have been connected, and the work consists of a support called a panel (meaning a flat surface that serves as the basis for a picture, such as a canvas), a shape image contained therein, and a geometric pattern. And while most writers read things intuitively, we discover that the characteristics of his work come from his cross-sighted behavior of trying to twist things. It is the most important element in creating his art and is realized through a technique in which shape images and pattern images are inverted on the screen. Not only has he been using shape canvas (transformable canvas) since the 1980s, he has been borrowing comics as a form of his paintings, and as he has become able to freely use computers, he has been able to freely transform pictorial structures and images through high-tech media. The function was also utilized. Artist Kim Young-bae expresses the daily life of our time through images and symbols. The woman in the work “Untitled” also has large gray spots that seem to be vaguely floating in the air, and an explosion image that seems to explode social anger and the confusing contradictions of modern society, forming a strange composition. Artist Kim Young-bae is a brilliant pop artist of our time who was the first Korean artist to bring everything trapped in popular culture into modern art, but he is another unfortunate artist who passed away just before he reached stardom.",

As he said, this method is nothing but “a structure of paradox revealed through erasure.” Because many colors have been built up, when you cut away a part with a chisel, the color dots hidden in the paint layer come back to life clearly. Like the breath of life, it acts as a subtle rhythm. In contrast to the solid outer structure, the delicate inner rhythm creates a mysterious dimension of creation.

In terms of color, primary colors such as red, blue, green, and yellow are mainly used instead of the dark and gloomy tones that were mainly used by artists of previous eras. The juxtaposition of brilliant primary colors that stand out in my work has its origins in the composition of the colors (five colors) of Buddhist paintings or Dancheong, and although I use Western formative language, its roots can be said to lie in our Eastern spirit. Intense primary colors with high saturation can be seen as a revival of traditional colors. Black lines that move sometimes quickly and powerfully, sometimes slowly, or in a rhythmic manner are also oriental. This aspect is further emphasized by using diluted acrylic and oriental painting brushes. The white background suggests rays of light radiating from behind or infinite space, which is in line with the concept of blank space in oriental painting, which is understood as a reflection of the spirit, and the method of drawing by controlling strength and breathing is itself based on oriental painting as the source of the idea. . While creating this piece for this feast day, I created it while thinking about our beautiful and extravagant feast day, which is different from Western parties.",

Place a paper mirror (2m*2m) on the floor, place nail-studded wood at a height of 10cm, and place stones side by side in front of it. The nailed wood catches the light and looks at itself in the mirror. The world interpreted by that light is suddenly revealed on the wall. Here, the world is a world beyond reality where all objects are free from the constraints of time. It is a world of echoes and a world of sound of the Emileison. At this time, it is a world where the space of sound is transformed into a space of light. The physical properties of Hanji are in line with the world created by receiving light.",

                        text: "The fundamental questions that dominate the world of Han Man-young’s work are “time” and “space.” This question becomes concrete by replicating time and exploring the origins of space. To use a metaphor, he is similar to a philosopher or anthropologist searching for the “origin of the world.” So how are these questions reproduced? It is by assemblage. The assemblage that encompasses his world of work reflects the modern system of thought. This is because, unlike the world as a whole or a theological worldview, it can be interpreted as a metaphor for modernity built from a combination of heterogeneous fragments. Meanwhile, Han Man-young's assemblage is a device that reveals the artist's spirit and attitude more than anything because it inscribes time in space and arranges or expands traces of time in space. Here, assemblage should be viewed as a philosophical exploration that goes beyond formative methodology. Looking at the <Origin of Space> series, the illusion of perspective is intentionally eliminated, but one can get a glimpse of the artist's will to present an ‘instance of space’ by intervening another screen or three-dimensional space within one screen. This attempt to overcome the limitations of the flat surface becomes more active by utilizing the three-dimensionality of the box. If you look closely, you will see that by attaching a mirror to the inner side of the box, the reflected space that the painting indicates extends to the surface, which seems to overturn the order of Renaissance perspective. In contrast, the <Reproduction of Time> series is mainly composed of a combination of images extracted from Eastern and Western art history and everyday objects. These include ancient artifacts, Marillil Monroe and Hwang Shin-hye, wire, clock parts, and old televisions. In this way, the use of typical images/objects representing Eastern and Western art history and civilization is often compared to Duchamp's readymades and Warhol's pop art. Additionally, the way objects are used is reminiscent of French Nouveau Realism. It is said that the Nouveau Realists at the time witnessed a social phenomenon of coveting ‘wealth’ itself beyond material convenience through the products of civilization. So, while the Nouveau Realists inferred the relationship between matter and spirit in the context of capitalism, Han Man-young's objects should rather be seen as surrealist devices that mediate experience and memory. Assemblage, which recombines symbols extracted from different times, histories, and places, can be interpreted as an attempt to vividly reproduce an ambiguous reality rather than a combination of meanings. In the end, the surreal here is closer to the dépaysement effect that makes reality unfamiliar rather than an ideology.",

                        text: "The spirit sews paintings and prints. ‘Post-truth’ writer Jaeyeon Hong sometimes separates life and art and seeks art through her attitude toward life. The world in which he consistently worked was abstract. His paintings and prints are even eclectic. It enriches the area of ​​the image formed in this way. In addition, a somewhat unusual method called sewing is now used. The method of abstraction is maintained. And the screen becomes simpler. What on earth are we headed towards? conversation? In modern art education, Jaeyeon Hong chooses abstract painting. The meaning can be discussed together with the pursuit of modernity and tradition. To him, abstract art was contemporary and aesthetically pleasing, but something indigenous came into play here. It is a so-called calligraphy style. His paintings connect his own contemporaneity based on the history of Western art with the tradition of East Asian aesthetics. Regarding the flood of so-called contemporary art, is it anachronistic to still set artistry as a structure or relationship between visuality and spirituality? When dealing with his work, one cannot expect the ease of intermediate art such as photography. Also, there is no digital sense to be found. Still passionate about analog exploration. The spiritual in art is inseparable from his monkish temperament. Images formed through practice, rather than confirmed truths, are revealed in his paintings, prints, and ‘needle paintings.’ Mimesis Hong Jae-yeon's paintings are about forming organic nature or understanding nature organically and simplifying them. Even a small dot or line has its own meaning. Everything is meaningful to the writer. This means that mimesis operates as a principle that connects life and work. It can be said that for him, the distinction between pictorial representation and abstraction has already been transcended. Sewing has emerged in a world achieved through simple drawing and painting. Is it rude to writer Hong Jae-yeon to recall Henri Matisse’s ‘Origi’? There is a possibility that ontological and metaphysical exploration can be criticized as ahistorical, and the author deserves such misunderstanding in his understanding of Western art history. However, a gentle way to respond to this (Ron) seems to be sewing. When a screen that looks a bit like cosmology is presented to us with a less serious expression than before, we feel an aesthetic simplicity. If it is not pity, art supremacy, or the theory of art reflecting reality, is it the interest in life as a work of art that has captured Hong Jae-yeon? Perhaps the way of separating life and art, or in other words, abstracting it, makes this interpretation valid. Nevertheless, the attitude of considering the work method as the labor of life again integrates life into work. His painting aesthetics seem like a reflection on telos. An atmosphere of ultimate purpose exists on screen. With compassion for the little things!",

So, unplanned drawings have the pleasure of breaking those limitations to some extent. But on the other hand, because I don't have a plan, I feel vague and scared every time I look at the screen, so it feels like I'm trapped in the dark. For each painting, I try to remain faithful to the spontaneous emotions at the time. So, the results drawn on the screen often include plants, animals, humans, and geometric shapes. People often show interest in what is drawn, but for me, the amplitude of meaning given by the expressed object is not that great.

                explanation: "Everything vibrates me and the world with the theme of movement. Movement, one of the most powerful topics of modern art so far, is one of the important elements that defines the world and aesthetics. We would like to introduce artists who elevate this movement to the level of aesthetics. As the title of the exhibition titled “Trajectory” suggests, we would like to take a look at artists who use movement as a drawing and carry out aesthetic movement at another level. Artist Jeong Seok-woo's large-scale abstract paintings show movement on a broader level than the artist's own body. Jeong Seok-woo compares the movement of screen-paintings full of these kinetic characteristics with Mother Nature, which contains countless movements, when large-scale paintings leave the colorless and odorless exhibition hall and encounter the wide nature and world. Artist Johan Han records his every movement and makes it function as a musical element. All of Johan Han's movements and trajectories are DJ'd on the spot, and such DJing movements are also an element, creating a beautiful musical melody. As a result, Johan Han's DJing develops into a melody that draws his own trajectory and a metaphysical drawing. I am curious about what kind of trace Yohan Han, who leaves all his movements through melody and drawings, will leave behind. Artist Yunseop Kim plays a YouTube live video and draws a trajectory on a large canvas. You can see his tracks online, but strangely, you can't see his paintings. He creates paintings that can be seen in a physical studio but not online. His work, called the Blue Paiting series, uses a chroma key effect to make his paintings appear blank and shows only traces and traces, but the works to be displayed at the exhibition show two entities with specific shapes. What kind of work will his trajectory leave behind? Artist Kim Hyun-seok finds a certain movement behind the image. The source, use, transformation, and distortion of various elements that make up an image are his greatest interests. His persistence in finding the structure of the image and its transformation and movement is placed and filtered in the exhibition hall with its physical characteristics restored. What kind of new work will he, who works with the history of images itself as a trajectory, create? Schema Museum of Art seeks to focus on the movements of artists Seokwoo Jeong, Yohan Han, Yunseop Kim, and Hyunseok Kim, such as scribbling, inhaling, exhaling, and tracing. We hope to be able to show the four artists' trajectories and exhibit them at an aesthetic level at the Schema Art Museum, located alongside nature. Can we truly present the numerous movements contained in the world as one aesthetic? This is an exhibition to look forward to.",

                        text: "Artistic images, by themselves, reveal their original power again without having to borrow other senses. In this world of indiscriminate and flat images, if there is a place where the original power of images is more revealed, it would be online. I think the coronavirus spread around the time we began to think that the methodology of artistic images would also need to change in line with rapid technological and cultural changes. Dreaming of linking with the physical world we live in rather than an unconditional change to digitalized online content, I believe that the production of digitized images that belong to the physical world or are illusions themselves is inevitable. Moreover, from the perspective of accepting the post-corona era, I believe that this approach should be conducted and experimented with artistic and serious thinking. In this regard, the project I present takes a method of existing on the border between the images of the material world and the online world. The moment an image is accepted by people, a created image that has two different phases and forms will share with the audience a new experience that is separated from the original from the moment it is born. These experimental attempts require a clear online content production environment, and audiences will experience it both online and offline.",

The works prepared for the <Traces> exhibition are also a form of formative and sound performance devices, expressing today's segmented communication methods through fundamental physical elements and body movements. In the exhibition space, works that combine the traditional material called book filling and the shape canvas method and four works with tambourines mounted on speakers are installed. The sound derived from the works vibrates the space at any moment. By interpreting the concept of sound/vibration as physicality, movement, sound, or traces, we intend to interpret the behavioral possibilities that appear in the work formatively and further experiment with how it can resonate with the audience. By interpreting the concept of “resonance frequency,” which can transmit large amounts of energy even with the action of small forces, in a pluralistic artistic method, we aim to express the phenomenon of artistic actions being amplified to the audience.",

I am interested in the flow of consciousness formed through causal relationships and the culture of origin that permeates the commonwealth. There is a religious nuance to the work, and inspiration is drawn from the fundamental cultures of various religions. The topic I am currently exploring is about the consciousness of looking at possibilities. The cruelty that coexists with beauty is expressed through abstract painting by comparing it to the wild environment. The screen is constructed through constant repetition of meaning given both internally and externally to the work. I believe that everything in nature has a fundamental purpose. The nature referred to here is nature as a large unit, that is, the universe, which includes artificiality and presupposes an understanding that can embrace contradictions. The movement of energy toward a purpose is intense, interconnected, and coordinated by grand rules. It may be because of these rules that humans want to have dreams and goals, which are the driving force of life. The big theme that encompasses the work is ‘flow.’ Flow is directional energy heading somewhere. I don’t yet know where the flow’s destination point is or isn’t, but I think the traces of my worries and actions in the process of knowing that are the work itself.",

                explanation: "The artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition are new artists who have just graduated or are about to make a new start. The Shema Museum of Art seeks to provide opportunities to young artists and encourage the passion of new artists for their work in order to continuously establish a balance in local art every year. This exhibition supports the active work attitude, experimental spirit, and challenging spirit of young artists participating in the ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition, and hopes to create new challenges and opportunities for local young artists and create an art ecosystem in our region. The ‘Unstable Possibilities’ exhibition will be held in two parts, the ‘Unstable Possibilities 1’ exhibition will feature artists Dong-Woo Kim, Yuli Kim, Ju-Yeon Lim, So-Hee Park, and Min-Sol Choi, and the ‘Unstable Possibilities 2’ exhibition, which will be held in part 2, will feature artists Ra-Yeon Gil, Ra-Yeon Kim, and Na-Yun Song. A total of ten artists, including Wonju Yang and Sohee Ahn, participate in various genres including painting, photography, and fashion design. In particular, as Unstable Possibility implies, writers are unstable but contain infinite possibilities. Artists visualize unstable reason and their own perception of the world in various ways, and express their thoughts about the world we live in and art in their works, from their daily lives and individual stories.",

Since last year, there has been a time when everything stopped and slowed down due to COVID-19, and although it is still ongoing, the Schema Art Museum has collected and exhibited contemporary contemporary art and conducted Dream Attic Saturday Cultural School and children's culture and arts education with local artists. . The programs combined with new and diverse contemporary art created a time of new emotion through empathy and expression for tired infants, children, and their families. This results report exhibition is a result reporting exhibition in the form of an archive and exhibition of the progress and process of cultural arts education conducted for a year with Yongjae Shin, a representative local sky recorder, and Solmoe Baek, an abstract sculpture artist. I believe that the exhibition is a time when participants in all programs can once again think about the importance of social arts education and the role of art museums, and establish the Shema Art Museum as a public cultural space and a space for communication with citizens.

                explanation: "“Art is not a reproduction of the visible; it is making the invisible visible.” This is what Paul Klee said. Klee was born in Switzerland, but is an emotional and very rational writer who participated in the ‘Blue Knight Movement’ in Germany and also worked as a professor at the ‘Bauhaus.’ Because Klee was so good at realistic depictions, Surrealist artists invited him to join their group, but he declined and experimented with free drawing, exploring not only the strict cubic style but also pointillism. That is why the artist put more effort into expressing objects symbolically rather than realistically. Artist Lee Myung-hwa's work, like most other artists, begins with a realistic description of the object. Of course, you want to realize the image of the object through aesthetic expression, but you can see that you are trying to reproduce a new image by projecting your thoughts and life phenomena through the object you want to draw. Just as Klee drew visible objects, but did not try to draw what was visible, but rather what was invisible to the eye, artist Lee Myung-hwa not only tried to reproduce new images that could only be seen with his own eyes, but also drew on his own mind. We can guess that he is reconstructing the image he saw and felt. Artist Lee Myung-hwa is an artist who has been painting non-stop for almost 40 years, from his time in middle school to his participation in the art department, his time in college, and his completion of his master's degree in fine arts at Hongik University. As such, he is an artist who always thought about painting and immersed himself in his work, whether as a student, a middle school art teacher, or as a writer. In the meantime, I mainly worked on the subject of figurative landscapes and still lifes of all objects existing in nature, but quite a long time ago, I came across ‘Yeongeungkwi’, one of the many weeds. Thistle is a plant that, like all flowers, has an ecological process in which it germinates and grows in the soil, blooms, sends out its spore seeds, and settles in the soil again to complete its life for a year. As we observe the morphological characteristics of this thistle and re-observe it from the perspective of an internal perspective from the expression of an external image, the method of expression also changes. In this way, I think the <Thistle Flower> series works express the natural law of the creation and extinction of thistles by substituting it into the life of artist Lee Myung-hwa. Until now, expression techniques and forms can be summarized and explained as 'realistic expression', 'drawing expression', 'deconstructive expression of image', etc., but they are not bound by the realism of traditional Western painting and neo-impressionist expression techniques and cherish the space of the background of the image. By processing it, it gives the impression that it is borrowing the spirit of inaction and nature from Eastern thought. While realist paintings attempted to create the illusion of three-dimensional visual truth, Myung-Hwa Lee's works attempted to interpret the expression of illusionary images as more 'illusion', emphasizing the 'beauty of blank space' like the conceptual landscape paintings of Oriental paintings, and moving away from postmodernism. You can discover features that provide a glimpse into the 'vitality' of nature, which is important. In this way, 'Artist Lee Myung-hwa' and 'Thistle' are not opposing objects such as the artist and the object, but rather the subject and self that exist in nature, called the thistle, by uniting with the spirit of Eastern art, thereby raising questions about the essence of human life and, by extension, the existence of one's own life. You can feel that you want to talk about it too. Jean-Paul Sartre, a world-renowned existentialist philosopher, said, “From birth, humans are a series of choices between life and death.” Humans exist as part of nature. Ultimately, humans live in compliance with the birth and extinction of life in nature. In addition, the artist creates a work by dissolving his thoughts into the work and solving the answer through the technique and form of the work. From the formal point of view of the subject matter, Lee Myung-hwa's work can be interpreted in several characteristic forms. First, it can be interpreted that he is creating an aesthetic object that can simultaneously recognize the continuity and temporality of the birth and extinction of life in the thistle flower. Ultimately, it refers to the characteristic of recognizing the ‘reality’ of ‘thistle’ while simultaneously deconstructing itself. Second, we see that the object (image) and space (blank space) do not exist separately but exist simultaneously. It allows the blank space that is not drawn in an oriental painting to exist at the same time as if it exists as a part of a complete work rather than an unfinished part of the work. In this way, it seems that artist Lee Myung-hwa is using thistles to create the ‘mystery of nature’ and the ‘soft blank space’ as a space for the artist’s own internal expression. With this special exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art, we hope to make another leap forward by reflecting the external environment in a more unique way in the production method of these works, and by discovering and attempting new topics with artist Lee Myung-hwa's own subjective life and emotions.",

                explanation: "Painting has gone through many formal changes, from the Altamira cave paintings of the Paleolithic era about 35,000 years ago to the modern art of the 21st century, reaching its current state of art. However, from the perspective of the history of painting, we can point out a few of the most important events. The first event is the ‘invention of perspective’. It developed from around the 3rd century through the study of ‘Linear Perspective’ scholars Alberti and Brunelleschi, and was completed in the Renaissance era at the end of the 15th century, blossoming in realist painting in the 19th century. The characteristic of realist painting is not only the form of perspective, but also the principle of ‘light and dark’. The life of realist painting lies in the ‘perception of depth’ (Deep concept). Therefore, perspective and light and shade are the most important factors in making a two-dimensional screen (canvas) into an optical illusion that appears as a three-dimensional illusion. The second event was Picasso’s invention of ‘Cubism’, which dismantled realism. If realism is a technique based on one-focus perspective, Cubism completely dismantles the object and structure of the picture by viewing the object as multi-focal. Therefore, it would not be wrong at all to say that all abstract paintings that appeared after the emergence of Cubism were also originated by Cubism. The third case is Nam June Paik’s ‘Video Art’. Although the medium called ‘video’ was created by a scientist, ‘video art’ was created by Nam June Paik. There have been many changes in painting from primitive art to abstract art, but in terms of technique, the painting tools (charcoal, pencil, ink, pastel, conte, tempera, oil paint, acrylic, etc.) and the background (paper, wooden board, cloth, etc.) It is made by joining together (canvas, etc.). ‘Video art’ has completely destroyed these traditional characteristics of two-dimensional painting. Video art relies on the camera eye (lens) for both perspective and light and shade, so traditional painting techniques are excluded. Just as the ‘COVID-19’ virus mutates and mutates, the techniques and forms of ‘paintings’ are also being created as new forms follow the destruction and change of forms. Western painter Son Mi-ryang captured the form of his work from the negative images of photographic originals or camera films, which were common before the advent of media such as smartphones. Philip's original print shows the image in the exact opposite contrast to the printed photo. Artist Son Mi-ryang's work is a figurative image, but because it is composed of negatives, the perspective, light and shade of traditional figurative painting have all become unnecessary elements. While converting black and white on a computer to see the light and dark, artist Son Mi-ryang accidentally discovered a mysterious phenomenon in the negative screen. He witnessed the 'phenomenon of light and dark that appears to be the exact opposite' and 'the gray phenomenon of images reversed by complementary colors' and observed that Columbus had arrived in the New World. He confesses that he fell into a joy like the joy of discovering. And it can be seen that the artist is struggling to create his own techniques to efficiently implement these negative works. For example, you can see that an attempt is made to create a world of complementary colors emitted by gray light by limiting it to complementary colors. In addition, negative paintings reproduce images by reversing light and dark, but in terms of techniques, there are techniques such as 'Grazing', 'Sfumato', 'Scumbling', and 'Grisaille'. You can see that they are trying to save their image by applying traditional Tableau techniques. There are quite a few examples of works that use photographic originals in paintings. Lambert Maria's “LMW Pressag” (made in 1976) created a portrait from the negative of the person's film original, and Jurgen Klauke's work “Fotoarbeit” (made in 1986) This work depicts the scene of an operating room using a negative technique. There are quite a few examples of applying the negative development of film originals to paintings. However, I think there are very few cases in Korean modern painting where works are composed using negative techniques. Therefore, it can be thought that Son Mi-ryang's negative paintings are created while sharing the characteristics of realism, abstract painting, and video art in the painting style. However, in order to become a more creative painting, the screen must be reconstructed as a negative phenomenon rather than a depiction of negative reality. Contemporary artists must reorganize their works into a specific language structure. An artist's ability must be able to intuitively recognize a subject or idea, omit it, and change it. This is because art, especially art, purifies and simplifies external reality and the artist's own inner world, while newly constructing it according to the laws of the artist's inner world and expressing its essence. The essence is that a writer can become a successful writer when he or she can form his own unique image and objectify his inner truth, subjective life, and emotions.",

The Schema Museum of Art, which was launched with the meaning of the 'fountain of creation' of modern art, celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2019 and celebrates its 11th anniversary in 2020. Meanwhile, it has held exhibitions for outstanding young artists, Korea-China, Korea-Japan, We had a busy time holding international exchange exhibitions such as Korea-India, Korea-Netherlands, Korea-France, and regional exchange exhibitions such as Cheongju-Gwangju, Cheongju-Haenam, and Jindo. In addition, we have been carrying out many wonderful projects over the past 10 years, such as operating the Shema Art Forum, various special exhibitions, art experience education for children, and support projects linked to local communities. As we welcome the new year, we plan to start 2020 with a permanent exhibition of our collections under the slogan “Contemporary art as diversity and language.” Among the works collected so far, there are works by Korean artists such as Ahn Seung-gak, Ha Jong-hyun, Lee Seung-jo, Shin Seong-hee, Jeong Kang-ja, Park Jang-nyeon, Lee Du-sik, Kim Bong-tae, Jeong Hae-il, Kim Jae-gwan, Jin Ik-song, Kim Jeong-hee, and Kim Jae-nam, as well as works by Andy Warhol, Yusup, Mariel Lebeque, and Yutaka Yoshinaga. Works by foreign artists such as Kazuyuki Uno and Changshin were also exhibited. I believe that these are all valuable works of the Schema Museum of Art and important assets for our region.

                explanation: "'Thoughts through Gap' In-ha Kim's solo exhibition, which will be held at the invitation of the Schema Museum of Art in 2020, will allow you to appreciate the world view of the artist who has been working on his works for a long time with unending passion and obsession, working based on deep thoughts. It is an exhibition that can be done. Through this solo exhibition held in Cheongju, the artist, who belongs to the second generation of Korean modern abstract art, wants to make visitors think about all relationships and even the issues of mutual communication through ‘gap’, a theme he has been personally interested in for a long time. Professor Heo Kwon-su, a long-time friend of author Kim In-ha and a professor of Chinese studies, describes the gap between author Kim In-ha as follows. “What does gap mean? It can be called a ‘gap’ or a membrane that distinguishes it. There are concrete and abstract gaps in the gap. There is also a gap in our mental world. Gaps cannot exist anywhere. However, it must be appropriate. Even if the gap is too narrow, it cannot function properly, and if it is too wide, it cannot function properly. It takes deep thought and years of experience to get it right. There is a gap between every person and person, generation and generation, every job and work, and every thing. Relationships and communication take place through gaps between each other. For example, the relationship between the cylinder and piston of an engine, the door and door frame of a house, and the wheel and axle of a cart are those that most appropriately function as a gap. “They each need the other, and each does their job without interfering with the other.” In order to show artist Kim In-ha's world view on a canvas, she ponders over a small paper screen, traces the absolute position of each shape she wants to express, and explores the language of the elements. This exploration and thinking is also intended to borrow the origin of the ‘gap’ and ‘membrane’ from nature or natural phenomena. Maybe it is a testament to organic imagination. The artist's thoughts are that through the blue color field, unexpected formative elements are created from traces or natural phenomena encountered unintentionally, and the intuitive pleasure discovered by the artist, whether artificial or accidental, becomes a catalyst for the uncertain work process. The ‘gap’ that artist Kim In-ha tries to show through her work is not philosophical or distant. It is a part of our lives and something we experience all the time. If you think about it, you may be concerned about how to adjust and reconcile the gaps in your life. This exhibition, which approaches the audience with the philosophical meaning and principle of ‘gap’ through a blue-colored abstract screen, is an exhibition where you can feel the artist’s attitude, true efforts and process for his work.",

Maybe it is a testament to organic imagination. At the same time, I want to be liberated from the image I have already become accustomed to. The intuitive pleasure I discovered in the traces I came across inadvertently or in unexpected formative elements in natural phenomena, whether they were artificial or accidental, became a catalyst for the uncertain work process. That was the case with the Daisam Beach in the South Sea that I inadvertently encountered, as were the meaningless scattered brush strokes and fluttering droplets of paint. I imagine the result, which is neither creative nor intentional. I do work where language is shaped, emotions are symbolized, and intuition is materialized through imagination. According to ‘Herbert Read’, the images of products born under the pretext of ‘creation’ are not created but taken from the visible world. This means that the original forms originating from nature or natural phenomena are being borrowed. It is an expression of the characteristics and spirit of the times in that world.",

                explanation: "‘Oblique border’ ‘Oblique border’ starts from the idea that ‘today’s painting is truly pluralistic.’ Today's art is moving towards multiple aspects, as if it is expanding infinitely without boundaries in the use of media. But there are some things that haven't changed. In this rapidly changing world of modernism and postmodernism, even in this era when the concept of modern art has expanded infinitely, painting is the centerpiece. ‘Oblique Boundaries’ features artists who cross the boundaries of painting while working with traditional media, and five artists who cross the boundaries of pictorial perspective using animation techniques on a hyper-plane screen. Five artists, Kang Joo-hyung, Kim Yun-ho, Na Su-min, Lee Seung-hoon, and Hong Garam, want to think again about today's contemporary art through their works. Participating artists are reborn in their own visual ways using comics as new materials, including current social stories that are problematic in our society, personal problems encountered in that society, and the cultural codes of the times. We confirm that these attempts are bringing about many changes in the system of our thinking and the way we look at objects in contemporary art, and we aim to create and share opportunities to appreciate expanded visual art with local visitors. Artist Kang Joo-hyung shows familiar time and materials, and their mobility, in ‘Time-Painting.’ Objects in society and daily life acquire movement and build up color one after another. Existing objects are transformed into new objects through the artist's weaving. Instead of reproducing familiar shapes or movements, it presents newly produced objects and the surfaces on which they move. The objects in the work claim to be isolated in their respective time and space, while at the same time not giving up on forming relationships. Artist Kang Joo-hyung's images are expanded through repetition and experimentation with brush strokes on digital media rather than canvas. Artist Yunho Kim's creative work can be said to be a phenomenon of comic imagination based on badminton, which the author enjoys playing. The author values ​​the medium of comics as a cultural code of the era in which he grew up and is familiar with the emotions and grammar of pop culture. Above all, J-Pop's cartoons, such as <Ping Pong>, <Overlord>, and <Helper>, have a free-spirited otaku sensibility that purely depicts the human body and other bodies, as well as the freedom of transformation, freedom of spatial transformation, and freedom of perspective movement. Express it clearly. His imagination, which begins with the feathers of a shuttlecock, extends to the original flow of life and even shows the sound of its speed through his cartoon imagination in the author's unique medium. Author Na Sumin is a member of the youth generation and depicts the youth of this era. It captures minimum wage issues, youth labor, and the daily lives of young people who refuse to communicate with society and choose solitude. While there are youth who focus on social messages and live busy lives, moving from objective and realistic methods to surreal expression methods, it shows young people who refuse to communicate with society and choose alienation. The artist's thoughts create his own world in paintings that will comfort everything by capturing the work in pink. Artist Seunghoon Lee creates several individual images and displays them on the screen based on clues from everyday memories he has experienced. The images are images of daily life, such as a man dozing off while sitting on a plastic chair on the street, looking very drunk, plane trees and fluttering leaves, people walking and a fountain spouting water, etc., displayed on the screen as individual images without sharing a single space and time. Show it floating. At this time, the artist uses a process of observing and perceiving an object that never stops, rather than using realistic expressions, to display it as a pictorial screen beyond animation rather than an exact reproduction on a hyper-plane screen. It can be said that what is important to the artist is not ‘reproduction’ but the ‘drawing process’ itself. The social scenes the artist sees are carried out while holding a tablet pen in front of the pixels of an extremely enlarged screen. Artist Hong Garam begins with a critical awareness of current commercial animation. The artist's animation work deconstructs and combines movement-images called planks in the montage that makes up the film as a whole, and reconstructs it like a moving picture. Or, it is said that it is making a ‘picture film’. So it is said that it is located somewhere between the movie version and the painting. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the video is ‘located’ rather than ‘screened.’ In order to approach the viewer in a way that blurs the distinction between exhibition and screening, artist Hong Garam uses independent display equipment to repeatedly reproduce the work like a painting and turn it into an object as a single plan.",

                explanation: "On the occasion of the Korea-France Korean Artists Special Exhibition, the 7th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition 'Korea-France Korean Artists-Special Exhibition' was the 6th exhibition in 2019 at 'Gallery 89' in Paris, where 15 Korean artists participated in June last year. This exhibition continues from the Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition “New Dialogue Paris”. Currently, the world is in the throes of a pandemic, which is not a problem for any one country, but rather a problem for the whole world, as 'COVID-19', which originated in China at the end of last year, has spread rapidly around the world. Due to these unexpected circumstances, there are many difficulties in holding the 7th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, but even in this crisis situation, if we all faithfully fulfill our roles in our respective positions and carry out artistic and cultural exchange, this exhibition will be held as a successful international exchange exhibition. I have no doubt that it will happen. This “Korean Artists from France – Special Exhibition” will feature 14 invited artists. The seven returning artists who are invited to exhibit are all excellent artists who have solidified their positions as artists in the art world of Paris, France. Senior painters Cho Don-young and Kwon Soon-cheol, Ko Song-hwa and Kwak Soo-young, who are the most active painters among the mid-level artists, Kim Myeong-nam, a professor at the Versailles College of Fine Arts and active as a female painter, and especially the president of the 'Pine Artists Association' group, a Korean art group living in France. Many artists, including artist Lee Young-in and Yoon Hye-seong, who are active as leaders of Korean artists, are active in the Parisian art world. We invited seven Korean living artists and collaborated on the works of seven Korean artists. Korean artists in Paris are Korean artists who have already settled in Paris 40 years ago. In addition, the seven Korean artists invited were four contemporary artists representing the Cheongju art world: Kim Jae-gwan, Yeon Young-ae, Jin Ik-song, and Lim Eun-soo, and the seven artists included Joo Tae-seok and Lee Yeol, professors at Hongik University College of Fine Arts, and Lee In-seop, president of the Seoul Art Association. I did it. Most of the artists are leading artists in the Korean art world who are active in Seoul and Cheongju. Paris, France is the center of world art where modern art was born, and even after a century, its influence continues and I think it cannot be denied that it still presents us with new ideals and the future of modern art. In particular, I believe that the senior and senior artists who participated in the ‘7th Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition’ are the living history of today’s changing contemporary art. Through this exhibition, we would like to think about the current process and changes in Korean contemporary art and suggest another beginning. The Schema Museum of Art has been holding international exhibitions every year since its opening in 2009, and in particular, this “Korean-French Korean Artists Special Exhibition,” which was organized in collaboration by inviting living and working French artists working in Paris, is the most meaningful international exhibition held in Cheongju than any other event. I think so.",

                explanation: "“The works being exhibited in this solo exhibition are a series of three-dimensional compositions in a form that is the opposite of drawing. The theme of the exhibition is “Variations of Life,” which gives the impression of a theme that is far removed from the image of the work. However, in modern art, it is common for the concept of the work and the visual image to not necessarily match. Kim Kyung-ae's new works are composed of new combinations of structures without volume, separated from (or separated from) the plane (ground). I can glimpse his developed potential once again in this work. At first glance, his work is reminiscent of the futurist art pursued by geometric constructivist art in the early 20th century and the work of Vladimir Tattlin. At this time, aesthetics refused to reproduce any objects from the outside world, and it can be seen that works were created only with a combination of formative elements reduced to pure shapes. Although the theme of Kim Kyeong-ae's work starts from a very lyrical and sensuous point, as she said, 'Variation of life,' her work is developed in a direction that emphasizes essential formative elements and denies unnecessary decoration in terms of expression method. This is because, in essence, art is something that brings out not only the visible things that exist in this world, but also the illusions in our thoughts, creating them into new images, and infusing them with ‘life’ with philosophical principles and concepts.” (Kim Kyeong-ae's work; Purity and Possibility (4), Kim Jae-gwan, Doctor of Fine Arts, Director of Schema Art Museum) Artist Kim Kyeong-ae's 8th solo exhibition will be held from August 13 to August 30 at the Schema Art Museum. The artist is actively active in a wide range of art fields in the Chungbuk region and was selected for the 2020 Chungbuk Cultural Foundation's Outstanding Creative Support Award. Artist Kim Kyeong-ae considers ‘time’, which is given equally to everyone, and the ‘life’ lived within it, and visualizes the story of a twisted life that changes due to human desires and choices using formative language. The author presents the issue of ‘human life and desire’ through his work in order to self-purify while living in reality in a society where interests are complexly intertwined. In addition, through my work, I try to convey a message of solidarity and not to lose my challenging attitude and positivity amidst the unpredictable flow and choices of life. Writer Kim Kyung-ae said, “When you always look at an object with an awake mind and a new perspective, and focus and immerse yourself in your own mind and unconsciousness, you can discover your own identity and newness. It is the attitude of an artist to challenge and create without fear of new things. “Life.” Kyung-ae Kim graduated from Chungbuk National University's College of Education's Department of Art Education and its graduate school, and is currently working as an art teacher at Chungju Jungang Middle School. He has held 8 solo exhibitions, 11 solo exhibitions at art fairs and booths, and is actively engaged in several group exhibitions as a member of the Korean Art Association. It is expected that we will be able to get a glimpse of artist Kim Kyung-ae's developed potential once again in this exhibition.

As a female writer, the author seeks to show the clear energy, delicacy, and subtle beauty felt in the nature of the garden, as well as the author's unique sensitivity resulting from communication with nature. The artist's own small world is captured using a variety of printmaking techniques that are neither grandiose nor heavy that anyone can relate to. The artist mainly produces etchings. Etching, aquatint, and soft ground techniques are used to draw and etch lines on thin parchment paper with a pencil, and especially soft ground techniques to express realistic leaf veins using real leaves. In the printing process, parts of the image of the work are cut out on thin Korean paper, colored with watercolor, and collaged onto a copper plate. (Chin collet - meaning to glue in French) While working on drawings, paintings, and prints, the artist made many attempts to create works without editions using the plurality of prints. Collage using thin Korean paper or engraving on a painting to create natural overlapping images. In addition, the clear and transparent beauty of nature is expressed by using many colors on one plate, like a painting, rather than a monochromatic print. In particular, the plants with thin and transparent petals in the blueprint work created a shape that showed good contrast in shade, and strong shadows and volume were expressed in an interesting way depending on the intensity of light. In this way, work using natural objects as direct materials for works began in the early 2000s with the use of juice from chamomile flowers. The appearance in nature is beautiful, but if you look inside, you can see wounds and tears, such as torn butterfly wings, dead insects, and dead birds. Our lives are also finite, unstable and lonely. Through the work, both ecologically realistic and heterogeneous parts exist together, and irony or human desire is expressed through the relationship between butterflies and butterflies that cannot get along, such as when a butterfly is looking for nectar but there is no nectar in a flower. The characters and eyes that are occasionally seen in the artist's works are also images of the self that has penetrated into nature. The flower petal work that appears throughout artist Heo Moon-jeong’s 2020 ‘my garden’ work becomes the artist’s main motif. The artist freely applies the plates and drawings made by drawing natural objects and collecting flower petals and leaves, silently accumulating the essential appearance of nature, the relationship with life history, and the emotions accumulated in life, and putting the artist's unique sensibility into his work. . This exhibition is an exhibition where you can see both the artist's sensitivity and expressive power. It is a personal exhibition that will be especially good for appreciating the disappearing technical methods of printmaking and thinking about the plurality of printmaking.",

Their motto is 'the desire for new artistic expression and the search for various expression methods in modern art', and their work highlights the delicacy and unique sensitivity of female artists and the imagery embedded in the artists' lives. We aim to show the expanded world of work through unique methods of expression. In particular, this is an exhibition that allows you to feel the passion to create a local fine arts ecosystem while at the same time saying goodbye to Cheongju University's Department of Painting, which will disappear starting next year. Through the diversity of contemporary art and the questions of contemporary contemporary art, 'Inhale, Exhale' examines the flow of contemporary art in the Cheongju region of North Chungcheong Province for 27 years and seeks to present the direction of contemporary art of this era through continuous exchanges between artists. . In addition, like the meaning of ‘On the Road’, it implies that the participating artists of ‘Inhale, Exhale’, which has a 27-year history, are still on the move, seeking a path to diversity toward new art and modern art. Through these ongoing exchanges and research on the work, we hope to create communication opportunities and a stepping stone for the fine arts ecosystem, which is collapsing due to local indifference and alienation, and for majors and prospective artists. In addition, it is expected that it will provide an opportunity for local residents to appreciate a variety of contemporary art and communicate with art.",

                explanation: "The ‘Aspect’ association, a leading contemporary art group in Cheongju, was founded in 1988 by Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art, as its first president, and celebrates its 32nd anniversary this year. From 2000, the group name was changed to ‘Late Aspect’, making a developmental change to adapt to the postmodern era. And through exhibitions, seminars, and symposiums, it has served as a driving force to further accelerate the creativity of artists. Meanwhile, Chungcheongbuk-do's first international exchange exhibition, Aspect Coterie, began in 1991 with the “Korea-Japan New Generation Artists Exhibition” at the Seibu Museum of Art in Funabashi, Japan, and continued for 15 years with a second exhibition at the Cheongju National Museum the following year. Afterwards, exchange exhibitions between Cheongju and Tokyo, Funabashi, and Chiba continued, serving as a motif for the rapid development of Cheongju's contemporary art. In addition, Aspect established the ‘Chungbuk Youth Art Award’ and held it 10 times so far, focusing on nurturing young artists. The spirit of Aspect is a club composed of professional writers who pursue a creative spirit, transcending all differences in school, regionalism, and generation. The “Seowon-gyeong Walk – Cheongju-Jeonju Contemporary Art Exhibition” held by the Jeonju Contemporary Art Group and the Cheongju Schema Art Museum in 2020 can also be said to be a meaningful event that can greatly contribute to the exchange and development of contemporary art between regions. Cheongju and Jeonju are cities with very similar local sentiments and cultural climates that value tradition and modernity. In addition, I think this exhibition is an event with greater meaning because it is jointly planned by the ‘Shema Art Museum’ in Cheongju and the ‘Gyodong Art Museum’ in Jeonju, which are leading contemporary art in both regions. This year, the “Seowongyeong Walk – Cheongju-Jeonju Contemporary Art Exhibition” will be held at the Schema Art Museum in Cheongju, using the name ‘Seowongyeong’, the old name of Cheongju during the Three Kingdoms period, but next year it will be held at the Gyodong Art Museum in the middle of Jeonju Hanok Village. am. This Seowon-gyeong Walk – Cheongju-Jeonju Contemporary Art Exhibition” features 12 Jeonju artists (Kang Hyeon-deok, Kim Kyung-hee, Kim Doo-hae, Kim Boo-gyeon, Kim Wan-sun, Kim Pan-muk, Beom Jun, Lee Gwang-cheol, Lee Bo-young, Lee Il-sun, Lim Hee-seong, Cho Hyeon-dong) and 12 Cheongju artists (Kim Jae-kwan). , Jang Baek-sun, Kwon Osang, Kim Seong-mi, Kim Young-ran, Moon Sang-wook, Park Young-hak, Park Jin-myeong, Ki-soo Lee, Eun-soo Lim, Gyu-rak Choi, and Min-geon Choi) participate in this exhibition, where you can appreciate 28 pieces of contemporary art from 24 artists, reflecting the current state of the two regions. This is an exhibition that showcases the experiments and art of artists who seek to present newness and find new alternatives beyond the time of modernity.",

                explanation: "In Alice in Wonderland, the White Rabbit periodically checks his watch and runs somewhere. Does it symbolize the one-sided direction and narrative of time? Various perspectives and opinions on time and space have provided much inspiration to art through modernism and postmodernism. The material ‘time’, which has perhaps become the last material of postmodernism, still has many aspects that need to be explored. In this context, this special exhibition ‘Rabbit Chaser’ is an exhibition that focuses on how modern artists chase time, combine the space-time and meaning derived from it, and derive new methodologies. I believe that strange or enigmatic new methods of meaning, such as the strange events and scenes in Wonderland, will become a driving force for new creations for all writers. I hope that the works submitted to this special exhibition and the new works produced will be an unfamiliar and creative experience like Alice's Adventure for the participating artists and the audience. The invited artists realize and reveal new works with a new topic in mind: the regulation of temporality. The audience has the opportunity to reflect on the avant-garde nature of modern art and think about its modern characteristics as a thing of the past, allowing for a new self-definition of modernity. The participating artists of ‘Rabbit Chaser’ consist of five writers: Kim Yun-seop, Kim Yun-ho, Lim Seung-gyun, Shin Yong-jae, and Hwang Min-gyu. The main point of the exhibition is to show the methodology of how these five artists use their time. In addition, the issue of how work is transformed, planned, and expressed using non-art materials and events is also an important perspective to look at. The main content of the exhibition can be said to be how artists with such unique perspectives and methodologies create new works on the theme of ‘temporality’ and break away from and develop existing methods. We plan to organize the exhibition so that new perspectives can be maintained and shared through young local artists and contemporary artists who produce serious and experimental works.",

As the exhibition title 遭遇与相处 (遭遇与相处), “Meet by chance and leave together again” states, we begin with the idea that Korea and China are the most important neighbors with a historical fate of disconnection and continuity. In particular, Kim Jae-gwan, director of the Schema Museum of Art, participated as a Korean commissioner, and Cang Xin participated as a Chinese commissioner. The relationship between the two artists began 11 years ago at the 2010 Korea-China-Japan Contemporary Art Exhibition, “New Center and Future,” and they are continuing their exchange through mental communication beyond their works and firmly maintaining their own identity.

In particular, as the Imperfect viewpoint implies, artists seek to show their imperfect reason and their own perception of the world in various ways and through their own medium. These visual images show the complicated elements entangled in each person's life, the pain and conflict of an individual's life, and seek to form a consensus of universal emotions.

The Schema Museum of Art promotes not only local and international exchange exhibitions, but also cultural and artistic programs for various age groups. The Schema Museum of Art is holding various cultural and artistic programs such as the 2020 Saturday Dream Attic Cultural School 'Crossing', the children's culture and arts education 'Art Star', the cultural day 'You over Flowers 4', and the art week 'My Garden through Prints'. We have planned and carried out it. Among them, a result reporting exhibition reporting on the Saturday Dream Attic Cultural School ‘Crossing’ and the children’s culture and arts education ‘Art Star’ program is scheduled to be held from November 25, 2020. The two education projects were each operated for 10 weeks/2 sessions (Garossaeri) and 15 institutions/3 weeks (Art Star), with a total of 13 families participating/49 people in total for Crossing, and 253 participants from 15 institutions for Art Star. Toddlers participated. Although there were many difficulties due to COVID-19, local artists Baek Solmoe and Shin Yongjae collaborated on the museum's educational program and used the uniqueness of the Schema Art Museum to help children immerse themselves, think, and explore in the museum, enabling integrated thinking. I believe that this demonstrates the professional education of the Schema Museum of Art. I believe that this type of education attempts to provide integrated education in ways that allow children to learn while having fun and to develop their learning through activities with their peers. I believe that art museums do not have a set framework for learning, and that the lack of a framework means that there is no prescribed learning format like the school curriculum, and that it is not an educational method without any restrictions or regulations. Therefore, it can be said that it respects more creative ideas and thinking and plays a role as a facilitator of local art education. Nowadays, art museums are changing and becoming new educational spaces and alternative educational spaces in the region.",

In particular, the female artist's delicacy and unique sensitivity, as well as the imagery embedded in her life, appear more dreamlike through the use of pink and white on the canvas. The visual images on the artist's screen show moments that everyone has felt at least once and fleeting moments that anyone can encounter, allowing for greater empathy.

                explanation: "Seo Seung-yeon's landscapes and realization of new images Painter Seo Seung-yeon is one of the female artists who has been working most diligently over the past 10 years. The main theme of his recent works is ‘landscape’ – especially ‘cityscape’. In Western painting, the history of landscape painting is not that long compared to the history of Oriental painting. The history of landscape painting in the East can be traced back to the time when landscape painting appeared. Here, we can see that landscape painting began with the concept of mathematical, geometric, and perspective scales, as in the English meaning of 'Landscape'. In contrast, landscape painting in the East does not simply refer to the appearance of nature, but also refers to the close relationship between nature and humans. It is called the premise, and it also contains the meaning of feng shui. In Western art, painting, which remained in a classical perspective until the 18th century, underwent great changes in modern art in the 19th century. However, classicism, naturalism, realism, and impressionism can all be considered pan-realism in a strict sense. However, the method, technique, and perspective of setting the object and topic are different. Realism finally recognizes objects as realistic objects, Impressionism has a new intuition that expresses the phenomenon of light rather than the substance of the object, and the outline of the object is dismantled, and Neo-Impressionist paintings interpret light through optics and colorology. You can see . Painting has several influences on modern art, but the biggest influence was probably the advent of the camera. Before the advent of cameras, there was an early camera called a ‘Camera Obscura’ that was used as a convenient tool for drawing pictures. It was a very popular drawing aid in the 18th and 19th centuries, used by many artists at the time - Venetian painters Antonio Canale and Bernardo Bellotto, as well as Dutch artists Vermeer and G.M. Crespi. Many artists were able to easily copy and draw the shadows, rays, and perspectives of landscapes using this device. Of course, engineers such as ‘Osborne Reynolds’ were concerned about their actions as to whether optical accuracy would lower the value of absolute imagination. I think this is probably why some people criticize artist Seungyeon Seo for using copies of photographs in her landscape sketches. This phenomenon already happened a hundred or two hundred years ago, and now in the 21st century, after Nam June Paik's 'video art', advanced mechanisms such as electronics and lasers are being combined with paintings, and photography is proudly occupying the main wall of the museum. It's an era. However, it is also an undeniable fact that realist paintings in modern art are facing a more serious crisis than when the camera was invented in the 18th century. Historically, most realistic paintings in the West were used as a means of monumental recording. For example, it was used as a means of mythology or deification of the ruler. And until the 19th century, natural talent was needed to reproduce images. However, in the digital age, painting, especially realistic image reproduction, has become easier than a piece of cake. Since drawing and drawing, which are basic knowledge of drawing, can now be copied by anyone through the operation of computer machines, a new awareness of image reproduction is needed. In the analog age, it was a “representation of reality” where reality existed as a fact, but the reproduction in the digital age can be said to be a “reproduction of virtual reality” manipulated by a digital computer rather than a reproduction of reality. Now, even the distinction between “real” and “virtual” has become difficult. In fact, it is clear that Seo Seung-yeon's “Painting-Landscape” is progressed through the technical assistance of mechanisms such as photography and digital computers rather than a reproduction of reality through drawing. The problem of reproduction in the 19th century is that while realism sought to realize a three-dimensional world along with the recognition of objects pursued, Impressionist painting attempted to solve the problem from a four-dimensional perspective, just as the reproduction of objects was interpreted through light and time. You can. However, as ideas about the meaning of painting, even historically great ideas, change, interpretations of figurative painting and landscape painting follow new concepts. Especially in modern times with the emergence of conceptual art, we can see that the nature and status of a painting are determined by the artist's own thoughts and interpretation of material problems such as paint and canvas from the perspective of how to draw an object well. Here again, we would like to look at the conceptual and technical characteristics of Seo Seung-yeon's work. First, when he selects a topic, he places the ‘image-landscape of the topic’ on a two-dimensional plane. In photography, the image is developed on the surface of the canvas, just as the negative image in the film is developed on photographic paper. In this way, his landscape images include the principles of plane geometry such as 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' in Euclidean space, as well as the concept of perspective, which requires the concepts of 'near' and 'far' in solid geometry. In this case, there is no problem at all. “Traditional perspective did not satisfy me. This was because the mechanical processing method could never fully capture the object. So, I was particularly attracted to the visualization of the new painting space that I perceived.” As Brach said, it is not at all interested in the geometry of shape and form. Second, after completing the screen setup, the landscape images gradually become blurred, just as the various components in Monet's work are reduced to water lilies and water, and what is in the water and what is on the water is at the limit of realism and the border between abstract art, and the visual image becomes blurred. Even the direction becomes uncertain. They seem to float on water or are submerged, and the images become more uncertain, giving them an ambiguous character, an important concept in postmodern painting. Ilyeon's contemporary artists are deconstructing the consistency of complex expressive forms in the depiction of objects and reproducing unique images with their essential elements. In this way, Seo Seung-yeon's work can be said to have acquired its own “autonomy of painting.” From a general perspective, the primary perspective in the expression of painting so far has been strictly focused on the issues of color and form, and has led art without paying any attention to the visual system of the depicted object. . Their recognition allows them to take a clear definition of art as “non-objective” and “absolute.” Seo Seung-yeon's landscapes allow for a break from the depiction of the objective world, and we can see that the artist's own unique world of landscapes, that is, is realistic and combines images and water to create new images. In order to be able to achieve his own purpose of existence, that is, the expression of his sense of the meaning of form, he gave up the lifeless copying pursued by conventional figurative painting and interpreted it through the concept of modern art. You can see that he is creating a creative 'abstract landscape painting'. Seo Seung-yeon, as she said, integrated the landscape and screen with water and said, “Meeting the dream of a new life.” So, here I think it is necessary to understand Seo Seung-yeon's philosophy and thoughts on water. “Early on, the Greek philosopher Teles explained ‘water is the source of all things and the principles of nature’ through water. Water is the principle of abundance and vitality, has clean purifying power, and the water cycle means rebirth. The image of water has the idea of ​​nature, the world, the providence of life, and the most free and flexible nature. Therefore, my work is transmitted as a vitality that enriches life through the cycle of growth, extinction, and rebirth through water droplets, the source of all things.” This article is a quote from an article written in Seungyeon Seo's author's note. In other words, Seo Seung-yeon is explaining that just as all objects are born from water, all the images in her works are derived from water, and that the images on her screen are created through the process of being born and erased according to that source. It is clear that Seo Seung-yeon is very interested in her current work. In particular, as can be seen in the formative language of bold colors and unique images in the subjective expressionist painting style that can be seen in the expression methods and techniques, the vital power of 'water' as the source of life force is filled with intense energy expression in his paintings. can see. Also, no one can deny that Seo Seung-yeon's paintings are growing rapidly, just as she is interested and satisfied with her work. We look forward to seeing more new and creative works by infusing water and its philosophical values ​​into his paintings. I have no doubt that the ‘Seungyeon Invitational Exhibition’ held at the Schema Museum of Art will mark another leap forward in the world of her painting.",

                explanation: "In Alice in Wonderland, the White Rabbit periodically checks his watch and runs somewhere. Does it symbolize the one-sided direction and narrative of time? Various perspectives and opinions on time and space have provided much inspiration to art through modernism and postmodernism. The material ‘time’, which has perhaps become the last material of postmodernism, still has many aspects that need to be explored. In this context, this special exhibition ‘Rabbit Chaser’ is an exhibition that focuses on how modern artists chase time, combine the space-time and meaning derived from it, and derive new methodologies. I believe that strange or enigmatic new methods of meaning, such as the strange events and scenes in Wonderland, will become a driving force for new creations for all writers. I hope that the works submitted to this special exhibition and the new works produced will be an unfamiliar and creative experience like Alice's Adventure for the participating artists and the audience. The invited artists realize and reveal new works with a new topic in mind: the regulation of temporality. The audience has the opportunity to reflect on the avant-garde nature of modern art and think about its modern characteristics as a thing of the past, allowing for a new self-definition of modernity. The participating artists of ‘Rabbit Chaser’ consist of five writers: Kim Yun-seop, Lim Seung-gyun, Shin Yong-jae, Hwang Min-gyu, and Kang Hee-jeong. The main point of the exhibition is to show the methodology of how these five artists use their time. In addition, the issue of how work is transformed, planned, and expressed using non-art materials and events is also an important perspective to look at. The main content of the exhibition can be said to be how artists with such unique perspectives and methodologies create new works on the theme of ‘temporality’ and break away from and develop existing methods. We plan to organize the exhibition so that new perspectives can be maintained and shared through young local artists and contemporary artists who produce serious and experimental works.",

For the development of contemporary art in the Cheongju region, we provide information on new contemporary art and plan creative exhibitions to provide local artists as well as local citizens with opportunities to appreciate good works and develop projects as a cultural community with the local community. By doing this and putting it into practice, we played a leading role in local culture and arts. In addition, it regularly holds contests for outstanding youth artists, international exchange exhibitions, and inter-regional exchange exhibitions, and operates the Schema Art Museum Art Forum to hold various exhibitions and workshops, expanding the museum's education, research, and exhibition functions. In particular, the Schema Art Museum possesses hundreds of works created by director Professor Jaegwan Kim over 50 years and over 300 other collections, and has planned 83 exhibitions and special exhibitions over a 10-year period to showcase these works. Works were exhibited regularly. This exhibition commemorating the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Schema Museum of Art can be said to be a meaningful exhibition in which artist Jaegwan Kim's 50 years of geometric abstract painting work can be enjoyed in his hometown of Cheongju. We would like to inform you of the exhibition 'Half a Century of Geometrical Abstract Painting - Creative Trajectory', which includes the work of Relation 81-02 from 1981, which has completed a major stroke of geometric abstraction in Korean contemporary art, and the new work Deviation from Grid 2019-304 from 2019, which is being created endlessly.",

Next is the ‘Korean Contemporary Art Exhibition’ held in Paris, France. I think it was very touching because it was the first exhibition held together in Cheongju by Korean and French artists. Last year’s “New Dialogue” exhibition featured about 30 works by French artists (7 artists) and Korean artists (14 artists). In particular, we would like to thank P. Marie Brisson, Marielle Leveque, and curator Gilles Bastianelli, who visited the Schema Museum of Art together with Eun-hee AHN, CEO of ‘Gallery 89’, to participate in this exhibition. Following last year's exhibition, 15 Korean artists and several Korean artists working in Paris will jointly participate in the exhibition <Korean Contemporary Art Paris - “New Dialogue”> held in Paris in June 2019. As you know, Paris is the ‘holy land’ of art that gave birth to Western modern and contemporary art, and is also a hub city for 21st century contemporary art along with New York, London, Venice, and Berlin. The Korean artists invited to participate in ‘Gallery 89’ in Paris this time are comprised of artists from various genres, so I believe it will be a meaningful exhibition that shows a cross-section of Korean contemporary art. Like last year, this exhibition is an international contemporary art exhibition organized by Cheongju's Schema Museum of Art and sponsored by Paris' Gallery 89. Congratulations to all the artists invited to participate in the exhibition, and also sincerely thank Eunhee Ahn, CEO of ‘Gallery 89’, for inviting Korean artists.",

A work of art is presented in the mind of an artist who has permanence and is not satisfied with his consistent efforts. Just as each person has a different perspective on the world, I hope that each work will have its own appearance and personality, making it an enjoyable time to explore the artist's thoughts and growth.

                explanation: "Left and right sides (left and right sides) - Exhibited at Aspect 2019 - The year in which the contemporary art club ‘Aspect’ was founded was 1988. That year was the year in which the 1988 Seoul Olympics were held, which became a new momentum for development in Korea. Moreover, it was a dynamic time when a new driving force for development in Korea was stirred by the opening of the 1986 Asian Games two years ago, so it was a time when expectations for the Olympics were so high that they could not be described in words. It was also a hopeful year when another art landscape was created in Cheongju. This is because the “Department of Painting,” an art major department at Cheongju University’s College of Arts, was established for the first time in North Chungcheong Province and ended its second year, adding new energy to Chungbuk National University and Seowon University, which were centered on the existing art education departments. 1988 was a time when the country's energy and regional economic indicators were good, and the Cheongju art world, which had been quiet without any significant development, became dynamic. ASPECT was born in this regional background. As the name ‘ASPECT’ suggests, 30 years have passed since it was born with the will to create new aspects and forms for a new era. Aspect's creative and avant-garde art group was born in this way, and it was not only the first in our region, but has grown into a contemporary art group with a national reputation. In addition to exhibitions, Aspect conducts the 'Chungbuk Youth Art Award', holds exhibitions of award-winning artists, holds various contemporary art seminars simultaneously with member exhibitions, international exchange exhibitions with Chiba Prefecture, Japan, and exchange exhibitions between domestic and foreign art groups (Cheongju Aspect + Gwangju Epoch), etc. I can confidently say that I left a mark that cannot be expressed in words. It can be said that several artists, including Jong-mok Lee, Gye-hoon Park, and Jeong-hee Kim, have further elevated the status of Aspect through outstanding exhibition planning during their tenure as president. As the founding chairman and current honorary chairman, I sincerely thank them for their contributions. However, even though the municipal art museum was established in the region after 30 years of brilliant achievements, it was indescribable to feel devastated when 30 years passed without a special exhibition because it was evaluated by the same standards as other amateur organizations. I even felt skeptical about why there should be a city art museum in the area. With sculptor Baeksoon Jang taking office as chairman last year, Aspect is moving forward again toward its 40th and 50th years. While most other art organizations are run mainly by alumni or hobbyists, Aspect has maintained its dignity as a professional club based solely on creative spirit, overcoming all differences in school age, regional background, and generation. Moreover, the joint steering committee system was recently introduced to bring fresh contemporary art to the region every year. 2019’s “Left and Right” paradoxically is a metaphorical message about the reality of artists who live in a hectic life when they feel guilty. I think it is our responsibility and conscience to present good exhibitions to the region. Today, after 30 years of history, Cheongju is on the verge of becoming a city of 1 million people, and not only the Cheongju Museum of Art but also the Cheongju branch of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art have been established. I think that all of these qualitative and quantitative changes are possible because of good organizations like Aspect. We congratulate the artists who participated in this exhibition and thank Chairman Baeksoon Jang and the executive team for their hard work.",

                explanation: "The 『Free Space』 exhibition was a special exhibition held at the Schema Art Museum in 2016, which was planned on the premise of confirming the boundaries of art that have expanded since modern art and introducing new areas of art to the public and providing a sensory experience. In the field of art where the distinction between genres has become blurred, we aim to experience a new space and experience the unexpectedness and novelty within it with six contemporary artists who talk about their own spaces through various mediums, taking advantage of their professional characteristics in dealing with contemporary art. This is one exhibition. We also aim to secure a new point in contemporary art by planning events that create new spaces through exhibitions. The “Art Creation Exhibition Space Activation Support Project” seeks to expand exhibition programs concentrated in the metropolitan area to regional areas to increase the utilization rate of idle exhibition spaces in the region and to expand opportunities for local residents to enjoy culture in the field of visual arts by planning exhibition viewings. Haenam Culture and Arts Center <Free Space Exhibition> is being held with support from the National Sports Promotion Fund as part of the 「2019 Art Creation Exhibition Space Activation Support Project」. Free Space The 2019 ‘Free Space’ exhibition is held under the broad theme of space (空間). In particular, this is an exhibition where family visitors and children can find, appreciate, and think about ‘space’ in modern art. I think that the concept of space has provided a lot of inspiration to writers through modernism and postmodernism. Through this exhibition, visitors can dream and imagine within the artists' space. In particular, I believe that the expression of space varies depending on the individual and the culture they belong to, and that new things are created in secret spaces or my own space. Six contemporary artists (Min Kyung-moon, Ahn Yuri, Oh Wan-seok, Lee Go-un, Lee Joo-eun, and Lee Ji-yeon) use space in different ways and explore ‘space’ with unique perspectives and methodologies. Beyond the inside and outside of the canvas, the theme of ‘space’ in video seeks to share serious and experimental perspectives through artists as a new medium. The six artists participating in this 'Free Space' exhibition, Min Kyung-moon, Ahn Yu-ri, Oh Wan-seok, Lee Go-un, Lee Joo-eun, and Lee Ji-yeon, use certain methods and materials to transform the work of 'space', an invisible non-art material. is being expressed. The theme of artist Kyungmoon Min’s private land series is ‘space.’ “Where is the most private space?” This idea created the ‘Private Land’ series. As Descartes said, “I think, therefore I exist,” human thought and spirit are the most private and complex. These thoughts are shown to us in images as complex as a maze. These thoughts of the author are expanded in the ‘Fragments of Representation’ series. Artist Yuri Ahn’s ‘The Sea That Cannot Be Harvested’ is shown to the audience as a single-channel video, captured for 9 minutes in the video space. The artist created a new video as part of the <Floating Land, Floating Heart> project series, adding progress to the journey from Texel to Jeju. The author talks about 'things that cannot return' and 'a heart that cannot be anchored' through several incidents that the author witnessed while returning to Korea after finishing his life in the Netherlands - the Sewol Ferry and the shooting down of the Malaysian Airlines. This leads to work by reflecting on the experience. It is a work that rereads the present through mythologizing legends that feature beings who leave home and wander for a long time and eventually return home, and beings who offer prayers and rites at the places of those who left. Artist Oh Wan-seok's module work is an installation work that connects small grooves to create various structures. Through the empty space of the assembled structure, viewers can experience a variety of spatial sensations and participate in the act of adding or subtracting. The module in which the audience participates is expanded and created with the flexibility to interpret and expand the space in various ways during the exhibition period. In the case of <underpainting>, it leads to a mental space connected beyond material things. Artist Goun Lee realizes ‘pictorial fantasy space’ through his work. ‘Fantasy space’ refers to a space that denies exclusive real space and enjoys aesthetic experiences at a sensory-perceptual level. The work is largely divided into the <Garden> series according to the flow of the subject, and within it, it is further classified into paper and canvas paintings, drawings, animations, and installations according to the format and medium. The female body, which often appears as a motif in the animation <One Moonbow Night>, functions as a passage for fantasy to escape from oppressed reality. Additionally, the ‘fantasy space’, a major feature of the work, is a space filled with visual languages ​​that make dreaming possible. Artist Jooeun Lee’s ‘Encountering an Island on the Road’ series erases the surroundings and creates an empty landscape. The empty landscape makes us ‘watch’ or ‘wander’ something while moving along the repetitive walking path, and we encounter fragments of contemplative images. And this is the potential landscape of everyday life. The author arranges and connects these fragments and leaves a travelogue of objects. The artist's travels with objects began in 2019 through the 'Still Life Garden' series, where he discovered and expressed landscapes by collecting objects to discover new spaces. Artist Jiyeon Lee began by transferring memories of space onto canvas and is currently expressing them using a variety of materials and expression methods. For the artist, expressing space is not simply transferring memories of the actual space that the writer saw and felt into the work. It connects to a deeper imaginary story within the space. Through such connected stories, we are expanding on whether the ‘imaginary space’, where the space itself is a playground, can be put back into reality. The artist's thoughts are completed with the participation of visitors. Through this exhibition, the works of artists created with their individuality and imagination can be directly or indirectly appreciated as an expanded expression of modern art and transformed space through a reinterpretation of ‘space.’ At the Haenam Culture and Arts Center, we hope that this exhibition will allow visitors to dream freely through the works of the six participating artists and to maintain and share new perspectives on contemporary artists.",

                explanation: "‘An unreachable point, an invisible point of view’ Kim Jaenam’s solo exhibition is largely divided into three sections. <Color Field Series> is a painting, video, and installation that questions and reinterprets traditional perspectives in art history through computer image processing processes, and <Coldly or Lovely> is a collection of objects, photos, and video installations on carpets. , <Lost Landscape>, a series of paintings, shows the concentrated work done so far. In particular, this solo exhibition provides a glimpse into the artist's secret history of objects and places as well as his philosophical thoughts, and his new work in 2019, <Color Field Series>, reproduces real objects with color fields and goes beyond reproduction to convey the artist's message through video, painting, and installation. This is an exhibition where you can appreciate media works resulting from new ideas. The theme of the exhibition, ‘an unreachable point, an invisible point of view,’ begins with the linguistic and philosophical question of this proposition. The artist looks at the concept of a square frame, a frame that has been lingering in his mind for a very long time, from a different perspective. The fragmented images of time and space recorded in photos and videos are reproduced by extracting the colors in a grid made up of dots, lines, and planes through a computer image processing process. They are all rectangular frames, no different from the black surface of charcoal that has existed all along, and they also touch the sea, which was like an unknown world with no end or bottom that has been the subject matter of my works for a long time. They are ‘points that cannot be reached, invisible points of view.’ In the <Color Field Series>, artist Jaenam Kim viewed the sea images, which he had previously expressed as a black surface, as a reproduction of real objects rather than as an abstract color field composed of various colors, and the colors extracted through a computer image processing process were used to create three-dimensional and three-dimensional images. Together, they were reconstructed with pictorial elements. The Color Field series, in particular, reinterprets the traditional perspectives of art history that appear in pieces such as Courbet and Monet, set in Etretat, Normandy, France, in this exhibition. The <Lost Landscape> painting series collects sea images of specific locations containing cultural and social memories and presents them in an incomplete state through “defamiliarization.” In order to evoke memories as an interpretant, black charcoal is painted and rubbed repeatedly on the canvas countless times, replacing it with a simple black and white color plane involving the body. The overlap and arrangement of these heterogeneous scenes leads to an imaginary space and a third “poetic language” that are newly interpreted through disappearance and the interrelationship between them. <Coldly or Lovely> is a work of collected objects, photographs, and video installations that focuses on playful situations that create unexpected new meanings by crossing the boundary between verbal interpretation and poetic language from everyday objects or situations. am. This work rejects traditional notions of language and images, such as meaning and acceptance.",

                explanation: "Meeting Bauhaus again The Cheongju Craft Biennale began in 1999. The 10th exhibition was held two years ago, making it 22 years since it began. In the meantime, there were twists and turns depending on the format of the Biennale and the personality of the general director, and there were various evaluations of its success. This year, the 11th Cheongju Craft Biennale in 2019 begins with a catch play called “Craft of the future and dreams” – ‘Mongyudowon unfolds’. The theme of the event is unusual and enough to attract attention. Another characteristic can be found in the diversity of events. Compared to practices that were limited to crafts, we can see a very broad consideration for local art in which everyone in the local art world participates. It is impossible to intuit that these changes are being implemented through the will of Mayor Han Beom-deok. Mayor Han Beom-deok is so interested in culture and arts that he is recognized by others as a cultural mayor. He has a strong will to revitalize the local economy and enhance the region's cultural and historical content through culture and arts. The fact that Mayor Han Beom-deok was elected in the last election and made a comeback as mayor after overcoming defeat in the previous election is very fortunate from the perspective of local artists and is very fortunate for Cheongju, Korea's representative city of culture and history. think. The economy is important, but it is also very important whether the market has an attitude toward culture and art. Moreover, this Biennale has greater meaning because the ‘National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Cheongju’, which Mayor Han Beom-deok hosted six years ago, remodeled and opened the former Cheongju Tobacco Manufacturing Factory next to the Biennale Pavilion on December 27 last year. Another important feature of this Biennale is that four private art museums in the Cheongju area (Shema Art Museum, Woomin Art Center, Space Mom, and Unbo Art Museum) collaborate to participate in the “Art Bridge” exhibition. The Schema Museum of Art is participating with the catch play “Meet the Bauhaus again.” We set a theme that fits well with the characteristics of the Craft Biennale. The Bauhaus movement is a comprehensive art movement in the early 20th century that spread the spirit of art to architecture, design, and living art, and I think it is a name that matches the spirit of the “Cheongju Craft Biennale.” I think it has greater meaning because this year marks the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the Bauhaus movement. The invited artists for the 'Meeting Bauhaus Again' exhibition are painters, sculptors, craft artists, and designers who earned doctorates in fine arts from Hongik University, a representative ivory tower of Korean contemporary art. They represent the pinnacle of Korean plastic art of our time. It was composed of writers selected from the society’s members. ‘Dream Yudowon unfolds’ and ‘Meeting Bauhaus again’ come together in collaboration at the Art Bridge exhibition. “Mongyudowondo” is a dream drawn by An Gyeon based on the story of Prince Anpyeong’s dream in 1447. The “Bauhaus movement” is a movement that promoted the development of German industry through the fusion of art, craft, and industry, advocated by 36-year-old young architect Walter Gropius. Cheongju is the ancient city where <Jikji>, the world's best printed metal book, was created, and is now the center of modern Korea's cutting-edge fourth industry and life sciences. Cheongju International Airport and Gyeongbu, Honam High-Speed ​​Train KTX Station (Cheongju-Osong Junction) It is growing day by day as a transportation hub. The Cheongju Craft Biennale is not just a simple craft festival, it is a ‘dream craft’ that makes you imagine Cheongju of the future, and it can be said to be Cheongju’s ‘Bauhaus movement’. I hope that the ‘Dream of Mongyudowondo’ from 6 centuries ago and the ‘Bauhaus spirit’ from a century ago will blossom again through the 11th Cheongju Craft Biennale. I hope that the ‘Dream Craft Exhibition’ and ‘Contemporary Art Exhibition’ held at the main exhibition hall of the Cheongju Craft Biennale and the Schema Art Museum will form a wonderful ensemble. We would like to thank Dr. Bokyoung Kim for willingly writing the review for this exhibition, “Encountering the Bauhaus Again.” We would also like to express our sincere gratitude to artist Ha Jong-hyun and metal craftsman Professor Choi Hyun-chil, who invited us to participate in this exhibition. In addition, we would like to thank the senior artists of the Korean Society of Plastic Arts who worked hard to make this exhibition successful. thank you",

Anything Space, operated by the Schema Museum of Art, has been carrying out artistic activities by artists and cultural arts programs with residents through the first and second half of the year. This ‘Anything Space Result Report Exhibition STORAGE’ highlights and displays the works done by resident artists throughout 2019. Artist Hyunseok Kim, an artist in residence for the first half of the year, views digital pixels as digital physical properties and explores their texture. He exposes the illusion of images that are constantly reproduced and transformed through the physical properties of the screen. Analog and digital paintings, animations, and installation works were presented in the Daejeon exhibition hall of the Schema Art Museum, and a YouTube educational workshop was held for residents of Anything Space. Another artist in residence for the first half of the year, Shin Yong-jae, records the sky every day, revealing the changing shape of the sky and his own emotional state on the screen. He has a unique way of working, where he fills the canvas without being able to see what colors are being applied, either in the rain or on a dark night with no light on the rooftop of his studio. This exhibition features a series of paintings called ‘Shapes of Night’. Artist Doyoung Kim, the artist in residence for the second half of the year, wanted to capture the current story of Chojeong, located in Naesu. Chojeong used to be popular as a carbonated water and mineral spring, but now not many people visit Chojeong. We conducted research on redevelopment and reckless development taking place there in the name of development, and made this into a video work consisting of three channels. Song Seong-jin, an artist in residence for the second half of the year, conducted a performance video work called ‘Gestures.’ It reveals specific gestures of labor remembered and worn on people's bodies in a society that demands workers, and reveals through art the role of workers in the system and the traces of labor imprinted on our bodies. Invited artist Lee Ja-yeon is exhibiting a sculpture in the form of an installation called ‘Red Nib.’ This is a new work that takes the form of a node plant that reveals the artist's contemplative attitude, and is a shift from the productive and subjective work that artist Lee Ja-yeon has shown so far to one of contemplation and observation. ‘Anything Space Result Report Exhibition STORAGE’ is an exhibition that is meant to be a repository in which artists who spent a season in Naesu developed their work and stored many of their memories of the time together in Naesu.",

                explanation: "The first permanent exhibition, “Flow of Contemporary Art,” planned at the end of the New Year of 2018, shows the various characteristics of Korean contemporary art since the 1980s, especially among the works owned by the Schema Museum of Art and the works recently reacquired. Expressive works were selected and displayed. A representative work from the “Conjugatin” series by artist Ha Chong-hyun, a leader in the second generation of Korean contemporary art and regarded as a master of “monochrome” in Korean abstract art in the international art world, a “nucleus” of optical formative order that is antithetical to abstract expressionism. The series presents to us the early works of Lee Seung-jo (1941-1990), a master of Korean non-figurative art in the 70s and 80s who passed away at the young age of 49, with its mechanistic formative beauty of strict proportions, and the image of painting by combining images on the canvas plane. Artist Seong-hee Shin (1948-2009), who was consistent in his attempts and challenges to overcome the limitations of the two-dimensional world, has two works from the 'Peinture '82-C, D' series, which were at their peak during his time studying in Paris, and are realistic with the unique Matiel technique. Three pieces from the “Untitled” series by artist Kim Young-bae (1947-2001), who composes the screen with repeated patterns through a combination of languages ​​such as space and image space, figurative images and geometric patterns, and a drawing integrated with the canvas surface by senior artist Park Jang-nyeon. One drawing using traditional techniques, and three works from Kim Jae-gwan's “Diviation from GRID” series, which were recently shown for the first time at the Youngeun Museum of Art’s inaugural solo exhibition, are being revealed for the first time. The works of artists Seungbeom Park and Taewoong Kang, who express surface textures with unique expression techniques, are being presented for the first time as collections. Lee Hong-won's works “Zelkova Tree” and Lee Young-ha's “Trees and Stones” are figurative images, but the texture of the surface gives the feeling of a new abstract concept due to the Mattiel background effect formed by the wrinkles of the paper. Park Dong-in’s “mosaic” work, which is a combination of mosaic-shaped paper or a mosaic of finely cut hardboard pieces, and Lee Seung-ho’s work, which is a minimalist cohesive combination of wood pieces, can also be said to be good examples of adopting the “mosaic” technique. there is. One piece each of works by Cha Dae-deok, Lee Seok-ju, and Joo Tae-seok, representative artists of the “hyper-realistic technique,” ​​which was popular as a style of Korean contemporary art in the 1970s, were also exhibited. In addition, the abstract drawings of artists Lee Sil-gu and Lim Eun-soo, and Jeon Ji-yeon's work from the previous year, which consists of symbols that transform figurative images, were exhibited. There are also works by Ki-ju Han and Deok-ho Jo, who achieved a unique position in the Korean art world with the Hanji technique, which emerged as another unique technique in modern art, as well as print works by Bong-tae Kim, Tae-ho Kim, and Nam-shin Kwak, who are among the masters of the Korean modern art world as paintings and printmakers. Each piece was displayed. One piece each of works by Lee Seok-gu, Kang Ho-saeng, and Oh Song-gyu, who successfully modernized independent Korean painting using modern ink-and-wash painting and formative techniques, were also installed. Additionally, two photographic works by Jaebun Shim and two works by Jihee Yang were also exhibited. In particular, works by Bosnian artist Jusuf Hadzifejzovic, Japanese artist Kazuyuki Uno, and Chinese artist Changshin, who participated in the four-country international exchange exhibition “New Art as Memory and Imagination” held in October last year, are also on special display. . These three artists are not only active at the top of the art world in Europe, Japan, and China, but are also internationally renowned artists. It can be said to be a very meaningful permanent exhibition, “Various Flows of Contemporary Art,” where one can compare and appreciate at a glance the styles that have changed and developed into various aspects of modern art over the half-century since the 1970s.",

                explanation: "This ‘Ha Tae-im’ exhibition, which is being held as a special invitation exhibition, is establishing its own area by presenting color band works, which are original abstract works. The artist plans to showcase his previous series of works in ‘Un passage’ by repeatedly painting and drying, and creating another color from overlapping colors, looking for the connection between the artist and the audience through color. Gorgeous colors blend harmoniously on the screen, and furthermore, formative harmony is a major characteristic of the artist's work and an appreciation point of this exhibition. El Dorado of Color, Tae-Im Ha's Silk Road As early as 1890, Maurice Denis defined, “A painting is essentially a plane covered with colors under a certain order before it is a horse on the battlefield, a nude woman, or any anecdote.” Above all, a painting is a picture surrounded by colors. So why did 20th century artists turn away from figurative painting, which had served the world for hundreds of years, and begin to fall in love with art of color and form that is difficult to understand? It is from the recognition that the role of an artist is to translate perceived reality into art. Ha Tae-im's abstract works, well known as <Color Band Painting> or <Color Band>, also start from this fundamental perception of abstract painting. I presume that Ha Tae-im's work probably derives from the following two influences. First, the greatness of Jackson Pollock's hot action painting and Mark Rothko's sublime color-field abstraction created the curved color belt, and secondly, it is the absolute influence of the abstract DNA of his father, He In-du, who was a great non-figurative painter. Ha Tae-im always said, “Art is communication,” as is her habit. When asked what the most basic and primitive tools of art are for that communication, the answer was letters and language. This counterevidence proves that when his work types are subdivided into three types, a series of works depicting the Korean alphabet and the Korean alphabet on canvas in the early 2000s are his language code for communication. Perhaps it seems to be the influence of French art, which he studied abroad at an early age. However, he gradually corrected his language code. I assume that I discovered in my father's abstract works that true communication is not expressed through such direct language. Although she is said to have been inspired by Manet's work called 'The Boy Who Plays the Pied', which she saw in her father's studio study as a child, it was only when the artist erased the imaged letters with color that she realized that color is a much more powerful message in painting than letters. I realized it. “Looking at the seemingly indifferent gestures of the brush, the repeated bent back, and the gentle colors that are not eccentric, it is automatically healing. “I think pink, green, blue, black, and yellow, especially yellow, are like a gift from nature.” “I get a lot of comfort from color when I use it.” Looking at the artist's autobiographical remarks, the conclusion is that the artist finds healing through paintings and communicates through those actions. In this respect, her work is a conversation to herself, and her paintings are also a message to herself. A passage into the inner self, that is her work. The reason why he assumed the theme of the painting to be <un passage> also has such value and meaning. In any case, the work he has been working on for over 20 years involves solving the problem through alphabet letters, which are the basic medium, and after the meaning of the letters disappears, in the early to mid-2000s, he focuses on color and changes to a painting style that juxtaposes color bands on the canvas. From a time when I focused on erasing, now at the point where erasing and drawing intersect, bands of composition and color meet as expansions and color fields, creating a rare, unique harmony of color fields. Her paintings are now anchored in the fact that, like Kandinsky, they interact and communicate with the emotions of color, and that painting is the accumulation of the act of drawing by crossing and raising color fields. The artist said, “I put up the paint as if I were writing a daily diary. With the color bands on the canvas, she takes a moment to catch her breath in a physically and mentally exhausting daily life, as if calm comes after a typhoon,” leading an ideal artistic life that confronts her own color bands, building her own world. Most colors always interlock or intersect in the form of overlapping layers, ending with a colorful orchestral sound. Perhaps the author describes this moment as, “It ends with a peaceful and calm ending that I want to reach. As the landscape of my mind is like this, the colors I choose in my work have become transparent and quiet. “The rolling waves are lowered and I look at the waves.” The meaning eloquently expresses the moment of deep joy in his work. What we should now pay attention to is the power of the pure colors given by the orchestral chords and transparent brushstrokes of those color bands, that is, the issue of catharsis and vitality of the soul. It's like Mark Rothko's work should give you the energy and resonance of meditation that makes you cry in front of his work. Needless to say, his pain of endlessly spinning colored threads without a comma, like a silkworm spinning a cocoon, will never be different from the pearl-like tears of beautiful creation. There is no doubt that Ha Tae-im is the artist who spins beautiful silk threads of various colors with her exhausted body. Perhaps it was possible because Ha Tae-im had the belief that Paul Gauguin should express inner reality and emotions by saying, “Draw with your heart.” Or, on the other hand, he may have been endowed with outstanding talent like Robert Delaunay or Jean Hellion, who created the world of painting with only precise outlines of color and simple, geometric forms, requiring intellectual control in emotional expression. Above all, Ha Tae-Im expresses the message of abstract language through color, the unique formative experience, and the originality shown in the color band. Ha Tae-im's unwavering straight-forward approach, which does not follow or chase trends, is the best virtue that Ha Tae-im possesses, and this will emerge as her most shining charm.",

                explanation: "Cheongju is like a basin now. Young writers of this era who have to go through the gates of numerous ‘recognition games’ are moving forward step by step with their own stories, with both a sense of futility and a huge dream. A basin where they have time to condense and manipulate something huge that they have swallowed. It is a place where energy gathers, and this place is closed off from the outside world, but quiet. The five artists who participated in this special exhibition are taking a break from their hometowns and collecting ‘original works.’ The solemnity and maturity felt by everyone can be read in this context. For this May's special exhibition, the Schema Museum of Art turned its attention to external artists residing in Cheongju and the surrounding area. Most of them are artists who came into contact with the city of Cheongju through the Cheongju Art Creation Studio and decided to settle down here to work for a while after the residency program ended. Artist Kim Ryeong-moon obtains images from all over nature and everyday life. Her paintings and videos are a resonance between the rhythm of nature and her own physical senses that correspond to it, and remain as works of art, like the actions of an orchestra conductor who dominates or makes it flow. Her method is a physical response to nature and the metaphysical world, and it is reproduced like musical scores in various artistic media. Therefore, her work is very musical and molecular, and is composed entirely of her perspective. Author Seo-in Lee asks, “What is beautiful?” based on the beauty and ugliness of beautiful things. We work with the basic premise: She acts as a magician who brings out beauty from the waste-like weights scattered around the construction site. Her paintings and installations present fantastic compositions, utilizing exquisite methodologies of plane and installation within the metamorphosis of pendulum-based materials. Through the combination of the two-dimensionality of painting and installation, the gap between ‘construction waste and a work of art’ functions as another axis of energy that shapes the work. Artist Seonhee Lee works to embrace the world with two major themes: consolation and consolation. Her work has varied from the warm image of knitting to various installation works. The keynote that runs through all of her work is the truly beautiful value of emotion. For her, art operates as a place to heal wounds, heal, and recognize reality again, and it remains as a work of art like the temperature of the world she sees. Artist Lim Bae Ji-hee begins with various fragments of unconscious memories and dream memories, remnants of memories that are not logically converged, and the shadow of reason. The power of tracing memories she does not remember or chasing the shadows of uncertain images and creating compositions within the canvas shines through her drawing and painting skills. Her memories covering the blank plane of paper do not lose their tension, like a readiness for immediate escape through the artist's hands and actions. Artist Seongwoo Han expresses the world with his own sense through his early figurative paintings. The artist, who used to work on shadowy areas such as the back of a stage, currently paints in his studio or in unnamed spaces, but takes the attitude that it has absolutely nothing to do with what it is. In fact, he is remembered as a being who pursues the texture of painting solely in the act of painting and rubs his body against the border between the world and himself, which is the canvas. I think the part where his work feels temporal and spatial lies in this realm of existence. I believe that through them, we will be able to dream of Cheongju's next-generation culture by taking advantage of the cultural potential of Cheongju and, conversely, the background of how they settled here.",

                explanation: "Paradigm of New Art This exhibition, 'Paradigm of New Art', is a special exhibition of the Shema Art Museum's collection of works, in which various ideas and expressions are mixed, and it is also an opportunity to appreciate the diversity and present of Cheongju's contemporary art in which it is realized. It is an exhibition that can be done. In particular, this exhibition, following the 'Bain' exhibition, is an exhibition of works from the collection of working artists and new artists who are active in the North Chungcheong region where the Schema Art Museum is located, and consists of another contemporary art work. Painting has been transformed into new methods and attempts by incorporating various objects and media into the work, disappearing and dissolving the boundaries between materials. These attempts and transformations are common features found in the works of the artists participating in this exhibition. The Schema Museum of Art strives to continuously establish a balance in local art and seeks to provide opportunities to young artists. These opportunities and attempts are meaningful in creating and presenting a path for a new artistic paradigm. Author Kim Ga-eul expands the story by creating images using Greek and Roman mythological stories and adding her outstanding expressive power and imagination. The traditional coloring technique of oriental painting is used to create vivid descriptions that draw the viewer into the image. In particular, the author expresses the coldness and cruelty of ‘Sea Witch Circe’, a mythological character, as well as the primitive human love emotions before being a god. The power of the images on the screen makes us look forward to the author's next story. Author Kim Gyeong-seop uses memory. For the author, memory is the beginning of the work's motif from the idea that facts that one has known (believed) for a long time can become lies, and lies can also become truth. In the work, past and present appearances, events that remain strongly in memory, and fictional scenes mainly coexist. The characters' facial expressions are erased, making it difficult to easily understand their emotions or situations. Through images with blurred focus, complexly intertwined time and space, and ambiguous characters whose expressions are unknown, we are talking about the uncertainty of what we know as fact and fiction. Artist Noh Gyeong-min's work begins with discomfort with conventional taboos and social norms regarding female sexuality. The ‘A Room of One’ series is a series of works that were translated into paintings based on data recorded and collected through photographs while visiting inns, assuming an unspecified man as the model. This work process tells the story of an individual's unstable emotions related to love and sex from a woman's perspective, and captures fragments of an enclosed space from a first-person perspective. The author observes men while floating in a space called an inn full of traces of others, and these observations are expressed in intense red. The unique surface properties of the red paper, made by overlapping, pushing, scratching, and crushing, tell a story of desire. Artist Park Young-hak has a contrasting effect through the use of lines and blank spaces, captures the abstract meaning and value hidden within the landscapes found in nature, and seeks ways to approach and express blank spaces through the contrast between black and white. The artist expresses himself through the harmonious use of charcoal and ink and a condensed color language of black and white rather than flashy colors. The charcoal and charcoal shown in the work refer to the relationship between black and white, corresponding to complete black light without mixing with any external substances, and show an emotion similar to the blank space of an ink-and-wash painting in emphasizing spirituality. The artist is continuously conducting new experiments with his own formative language, and these tests and attempts are leading to the ‘Garden’ series. Artist Kyung-Hwa Lee seeks to express restrained aesthetics by focusing on the spiritual aspect of Eastern thought. In oriental paintings, the blank space that is not drawn exists as a part of the complete work, not as an unfinished part of the work. This means that objects and space do not exist separately, but exist simultaneously. The artist's purpose is not to give shape to what is visible, but to create continuous communication through the formation of natural relationships between all objects. The artist's meaning emphasizes color and form, excluding traditional methods in Western painting, and is expressed by applying the artist's own expressive media. In a series of works carried out as part of her unique ‘Blurry Portrait’, artist Lee Eun-jeong captures how women view society within society and images of women’s existence that are not clearly revealed. Among the various images of women in society, she depicted the husband-in-law who lived a life as the mother of a family's family, and Na Hye-seok, who lived as a confident activist in the era in which she lived. The two lives seem different, but by exhibiting them together, viewers are freed from the prejudice against women revealed in society. They also contain images of women, such as grapes symbolizing fertility or bonsai that grows as they are made. Although the aspect of existence is not clearly revealed, the image of women shown in society is that of a bonsai created by social concepts or that of a mother who takes for granted and embraces her. The images on the screen stimulate the vision by creating a strange illusion through the use of light pearl.",

                explanation: "2018 Dimension complex Artist Baek Seung-ho's work involves creating and installing the roof structure of a traditional Korean house using a wire frame. Although it is three-dimensional, it is not a sculpture and works like a drawing. This exhibition is a solo exhibition showing all of the recent works from the Dimension complex series that began in 2003. The artist's work starts from various formative styles obtained from tea gardening, the landscaping technique of Hanok. Borrowing means borrowing from the surrounding environment and is a method of communication in Korean architecture that has been around for a long time. This idea is created as a visual metaphor for the harmony that harmonizes with the environment without separating the house and nature. The artist's thoughts begin with one-dimensional lines, but the works are completed with works that emphasize the conceptual aspect rather than the simply functional aspect of architecture. Furthermore, beyond the sculptural installation made of lines, the relationship between lines and shapes and shadows is considered, and space is expanded to show a macroscopic perspective. In a stuffy and congested modern society, Baek Seung-ho's three-dimensional drawing of a roof in this Dimension complex exhibition is a landscape painting dreamed of by the artist and a landscape painting seen by visitors, allowing each person to see a new landscape, and the Schema Art Museum is a space that brings out the artist's memories.

                explanation: "In 1988, the contemporary art club ASPECT was born in Cheongju. The founding of ‘Aspect’ in the Cheongju art world, where modern art was relatively underdeveloped, was significant as an important event in Chungbuk art. Since it was a time when there was a serious lack of human resources to engage in artistic activities in the field of modern art, young artists who had just graduated from college and instructors who lectured at the Art Education Department of Chungbuk National University, the College of Arts of Cheongju University, and the Department of Art Education of Seowon University Although some of them live in Seoul, some writers are from Cheongju. They gathered multi-layered resources, formed members, and launched the organization. At that time, in 1987, the Department of Painting was established at the College of Arts at Cheongju University and the Department of Fine Arts was launched, creating an energy to lead new contemporary art in our region, which was also an important motivation for the birth of 'Aspect'. When I think about it now, about 30 years ago, the environment of Cheongju art was extremely shabby. It was a time when there were almost no proper galleries, let alone art museums. The author, who is now in his 70s, was also in his early 40s, so most of the writers in their 50s and 60s who are currently active are young writers in their 20s and 30s. As the dictionary meaning of ‘ASPECT’ means aspect, aspect, direction, etc., the name was given to symbolize the situation of the times when the aspect of world art in the 1980s was changing very rapidly. During the 12 years from 1988 to 1999 during the Aspect era, young writers from Cheongju - Chang-Hoon Jeong, Bu-Nam Son, Jong-Mok Lee, Yong-Ki Min, Dong-Jo Kim, Hong-Won Lee, Myeong-Sook Chae, Moon-Ki Kim, Seung-Hee Lee, Ki-Won Park, Jeong-Hee Kim, Gye-Hoon Park, etc. - and Eom Ki-Hong, who had new connections in Cheongju. Daejeon area writers such as Kim Dae-hoon, Kim Hong-ju, Kim Sun-soon, Yoo Geun-young, and Lee Jong-hyeop participated, forming a relatively thick writer base. However, as the number of members participating in Aspect increased significantly, it fell into mannerism similar to other art groups, and the meaning of the new art movement seemed to be fading, so the Aspect Association was boldly disbanded and formed 'Post-Aspect' in early 2000. ) has reached a turning point in its relaunch. This refers to the breaking of the ritualistic and formal structure of an art organization and the transformation of the exhibition format from a membership system to a commissioner system. However, in the 12-year history of Aspect, the <Korea (Cheongju)-Japan (Chiba) Contemporary Art Exchange Exhibition> (curated by Daecheongho County Museum of Art) held five times and the exchange exhibition of Gwangju’s representative contemporary art groups “Epoque” and “Aspect” were held in Gwangju. The event held in Cheongju is also remembered as one of the proud events. As we again enter the era of Chairman Jang Baek-soon, we see that another developmental change is being sought. Just as the new Chairman Jang left many achievements in the development of the local art world as the Chairman of the Cheongju Art Association, I have no doubt that he will play a new role and seek further development as the “Late Aspect” Chairman. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Aspect’s founding. The late 2018 Aspect special exhibition <The fateful encounter> is an exhibition that proudly stands in front of 30 years of history. I hope that it will be held as a successful exhibition while retaining historical significance.",

                explanation: "Korean-French Contemporary Art New Dialogue This exhibition is an international exhibition held as part of the international contemporary art exhibition organized by the Schema Museum of Art. In the meantime, the Shema Art Museum mainly planned exchange exhibitions with Asian countries such as China, Japan, and India, starting with the first international exchange exhibition in 2014 – “New Asia Sympathy & Difference” – in order to globalize Cheongju contemporary art. However, including the “New Dream & New Future / Spheres of Coexistence” exchange exhibition with the Netherlands two years ago, the target countries of exchange exhibitions were expanded to include Europe and the United States. As part of this, this year it was held in Paris, France, the birthplace of Western modern art and the center of contemporary art. This has an important purpose and meaning in not only expanding the function and role of the Schema Museum of Art in Cheongju to the world, but also discovering Korean artists who produce good works - especially artists in the Cheongju area - and introducing them to the center of world art. This 5th International Exchange Exhibition consists of artists working in a wider variety of genres than ever before - painting, installation, video, performance, etc. In particular, Professor Kim Jong-geun, an art critic who has been studying and researching modern art in Paris for about 10 years, collaborated to conduct this exhibition. In addition, four Parisian artists active in the Parisian art world and mid-career artists living in France participated as special invited artists. In Western art history, 19th century art is still remembered by the public as the most beautiful art. Paris is the center of world art where modern art was born, and it cannot be denied that even a century later its influence still continues. Even now, Paris, along with New York, is where the largest number of Korean art students study abroad, and is also where the largest number of Korean artists currently reside and work in Paris. That's because Paris still presents us with new ideals and the future of modern art. Therefore, I think this exhibition will be a good opportunity to further elevate our local art. In particular, the 14 Korean artists are invited to participate in not only various international exhibitions but also major domestic special exhibitions, and most of them will participate in the exhibition in Paris next year, making this exhibition even more impressive. I believe that the first dialogue on contemporary art with artists working mainly at ‘Galerie 89’ in Paris will give us new messages, and I hope that it develops into a good exchange exhibition. We would also like to express our deepest gratitude to the CEO and artists of ‘Galerie 89’ in Paris who participated in this invitational exhibition at the Schema Museum of Art.",

The Schema Museum of Art has provided opportunities to young artists to continuously build a balance in local art, and this exhibition is the last exhibition of young artists this year. It is our hope that through these opportunities and attempts, local art universities that are disappearing and the local art ecosystem at large will be created. Unstable Temperature Writers often graduate without experiencing the temperature of society within the confines of school. Even if they prepare, there is no place that will hold a warm hand for those who have just entered society. The difference in temperature felt by the skin can lead to personal development, but there are also many cases where people are surprised by the temperature and disappear. This exhibition is about narrowing the temperature gap by sharing each other's works and discovering a place to exchange thoughts. We aim to achieve a small realization for communication by experiencing inner emotions, sharing of daily life, and the place of art in a moment of weakly generated temperature. Through this exhibition, we hope to create a venue where artistic concerns can be adjusted by dissolving artistic concerns through a wide range of stories such as concerns as an artist, criticism of work, regional problems, and survival. We hope that for young artists who are anxious about tomorrow, their attempts to adjust to the unstable temperature will give them the strength to continue their art, motivate them to express their awareness, and experience moments of comfort. Unstable Temperature 1℃ Artist Ki Ye-eun works based on her daily life. The lifestyle patterns of busy people in modern society are expressed like a puzzle using panels of different sizes, and the passing moments are expressed using line tapes of various colors and thicknesses. Contrasting colors and easily broken line tape are materials that express a world that has no continuity and is becoming patterned. Artist Dayoung Kim creates works using photos and stories. For the artist, photographs of landscapes become the starting point of his work because they are different from other people's thoughts. The work features scenes from the past and present, people who appear unexpectedly in some remaining places, and episodes. And in these scenes, the author mainly coexists fictional stories and factual stories. While passing by a large and wide reservoir at night, artist Kim A-hyeon felt great fear at not being able to see anything in the dark and only seeing thick fog at night. This work began with the thought, 'Is this fear the same as that of people who have lost their eyesight?' is solved using crayons, which we are familiar with. The artist creates a unique background by dropping layers of achromatic crayons on a black flat surface, and the physical properties of this background tell a story of fear. Artist Park Kyeong-eun is interested in ‘inner emotions’ that are trapped in the framework of society and works using acrylic as the main material. While thinking about how to release his emotions, the artist thought of himself relaxing in a private room without any restrictions. Based on this, he collected everyday spaces and created a 'room of resolution'. there is. A virtual space is created based on personal memories or daily life, sometimes in combination with external media.",

                explanation: "No Routine Installation artist and squat artist Doyoung Kim temporarily occupied an abandoned building on the outskirts of Cheongju City in January of this year and stayed there for a month to practice art-squatting. We attempted to regenerate the space through diverse and free creative activities in an abandoned space, judged the possibilities of various work-spatial experiments and derived a discourse, and also paid attention to the affect of contemporary artists' nomadic creative activities. Under the slogan of urban regeneration, we attempted to experiment with the possibilities of artistic and social hybridization of art and urban regeneration. For this reason, artist Kim Do-young recruited eight visual artists and attempted temporary solidarity in a relay format, and the participating artists carried out their own creative experiments through free creative activities for one day or 2-3 days. In this exhibition, what kind of creative activities did the artists in Cheongju do during that period, what results were created through those creative activities, did the works differ from their initial intentions in the 10 months of time and space changes, and what were the intentions? It is also an exhibition to find out why things have changed and, personally, to raise questions about the various reasons that change normal and certain creative activities. Regeneration of Abandoned Spaces In January 2018, in the winter when everything seemed frozen, I first met installation artist and squat artist Kim Do-young. With the concept of Nomadic Residency/Nomadic Artspace, he is thinking about and practicing the nomadic creative activity methods of contemporary artists within the current social and artistic structure of the mutually communicative relationship between 'society and art' generated by the regeneration of idle space through art. Furthermore, for advanced revitalization, the artist recognizes the identity of art that exists within the individuality of the region where idle spaces belong as a process for production and reproduction, and experiments with artistic reproduction spaces while simultaneously finding alternatives and sustainability of space. It is for the purpose. The fifth project space was Art-Squat 2018. 1 – 2018. 2 <Unlimited Space> Cheongju. This is the construction site of Chojeong’s ‘King Sejong Temporary Palace’, which is currently under construction. In an abandoned factory outside the realm of conventional space, artist Kim Do-young and eight other artists, including Kim Yuna, Park Jun-ho, Shin P., Yang Hyeon-kyung, Lee Kyung-hee, Lee So-jin, Lee Hong-han, and Heo Eun-seon, attempt to move between the realms of artist-work-place and explore the possibilities of different meanings. And the changing variables combined with the passion of the artists resulted in a result that combined a new process. The ‘No Routine’ exhibition, which records the working process and artistic activities of these artists, is a very interesting exhibition in that it is a nomadic project conducted in a place called ‘Chojeong’, where new storytelling is being created. I am pleased to be able to cooperate with artist Doyoung Kim in this attempt and challenge to overcome the limitations of the existing system on its own.",

                explanation: "Triple Artists Exhibition The Triple Artists Exhibition, the last special exhibition of the Schema Museum of Art in 2018, features three artists: ceramic artist Man-soo Kim, female artist Eun-soo Lim representing the Cheongju region, and Jusup Hedzihezovic from Bosnia. These three artists are considered to be representative artists who are excellently realizing the major styles of today's new art in their art. Ceramic artist Kim Man-soo says that ceramics are easily recognized as optical paintings that lose the sense of volume by controlling and reducing the sense of three-dimensional form. It is not a relief-shaped ‘porcelain’, but a flat ‘porcelain’ with a controlled vessel function. This type of work is a style that Mansu Kim has been immersed in for a very long time. While paintings from the Renaissance to modern art have tried to invent perspective and light and shade to somehow create a three-dimensional feeling, Kim Man-soo is trying to turn ceramics, which are in the status of vessels, into a flat pictorial form, taking the reverse idea. You will see it. Art lies not in what is common sense, but in what is nonsensical. I think it would be right to say that it is non-common sense rather than non-sensical. Having removed volume from the sense of three-dimensionality, he has recently been thinking about how to create ‘empty’ space in the form of ceramics. It is not a relief ceramic that adheres to a flat surface, but a flat ceramic. Artist Eunsoo Lim uses his body and mind as a channel for his artistic expression activities. It is a practical process to participate in healing and recovery by accepting life energy in space and connecting with places that have lost the will to live. The exhibition “Sowing” is a story about the cycle of life that leads to life, extinction, and rebirth. Life particles floating ceaselessly in space are transferred to the screen and drawn with a blue pen to reveal the existence of life. We plan to install life particles by transplanting life particles into the bones of animals whose lives have been extinguished, expressing the energy that is revived again, and by traveling to cities in the Balkan Peninsula and drawing with a blue pen on images of other spaces, overlapping the images of life there. am. Artist Jusup Hajifeijovic believes that if all art is about the transformation of stored objects, it is the objects stored in museum or gallery depots that nevertheless play the most important role. The transformation from trash to a valuable work of art shows the objects and shows the artist's perspective on the Earth's waste problem. Hadžifejzović says that whether objects of high artistic value or objects of no value – their final destination is a garbage dump – the changed function must first be relied on. As an artist who deals with inventory in his own unique way, he experiments with the process of storage. For a long time, his artworks have been presented publicly under the name of depo-graphy, and an extension of this work is scheduled to be shown and installed at the Schema Art Museum.",

                explanation: "Drawing, the boundary of daily life, landscape' exhibition hopes to allow people to feel the artist's individuality and imagination, as well as the various possibilities and experimental spirit of drawing through collaboration between genres through the artists' stories of daily life and the basic elements of drawing, which are especially fundamental in art. . Today's art has very different characteristics from previous art. A new medium of art that cannot be explained by existing genre divisions has emerged, and art that combines various existing genres of media to create effects that are different from before has emerged. The area of ​​drawing is also defined based on materials or techniques, but the boundaries are vague and can be distinguished only by approach and attitude, and drawing can be viewed as an act of expressing a fragment of the process rather than as a result. This drawing performance project, attempted at the museum under the name of interdisciplinary art, is carried out in the form of an unexpected exhibition between coincidence and inevitability, transcending the boundaries of genre and form, in which music, dance, and drawing that incorporate dance have been brought into the museum. Through this exhibition, we hope to create a time where you can feel the artists' individuality and imagination expressed through drawing, as well as the various possibilities and experimental spirit of drawing. Artist Kim Min-jeong questions the formative nature of the city and the speed of change, and captures an individual's even empty psychology of urban life in his landscape paintings. Kim Min-jung calmly depicts urban life and its scenery from the perspective of an observer, neither positive nor negative. The author's personal, dry view of the city displays bitter and subtle emotions that are translated into his work. Kim Min-jung's blurry landscape painting is a familiar scene that can be easily overlooked because it is the everyday scene of our lives in the city, but it captures the viewer's attention and footsteps by projecting the artist's lonely and lonely inner psychology as he looks at the high-rise buildings that are collapsing and will one day disappear into ruins. . Writer Kim Se-ok Why are there people fishing on boats in the sea, and why are there people farming in those fields? It seems like everyone has their own assigned seat. But does the world stop if ‘I’ disappear? Here, humans feel that they are simply beings thrown into the world. And a being thrown cannot escape from death. Therefore, life is like a soap bubble, a void in which one has to live with anxiety. Through her work, Kim Se-ok tries to show the world and her own existence, the emptiness she felt from being thrown away, and the state of life between meaning and meaninglessness. And starting with the sense of kinship I felt from trivial things, I try to communicate with them at eye level, and go beyond the sense of kinship and find comfort in the emptiness. Artist Seunghyun Kim often encounters value conflicts in his nomadic everyday spaces. Because we are constantly moving and moving, housing issues are especially realistically intertwined with our lives. The hope and anxiety that coexist within it are stimulants that make us wander aimlessly. That stimulus naturally leads to a nomadic perspective, and the artist continues his work of incorporating this into his artistic focus. Therefore, objects for transportation, such as suitcases, naturally appear repeatedly in the work. And sometimes, I bring in strange objects. The artist experiments to give artistic value to everyday materials that are cheap and easy to obtain. By doing so, I want to think about the value of existence that blooms helplessly in the gap between life and art, and the interest in various objects is expressed in various ways such as three-dimensional and two-dimensional, video, and music. Cellist Go Young-cheol and contemporary dancer Han Song will create and express small themes of everyday life with their bodies through a combination of classical and contemporary dance in this exhibition 'Drawing the Boundaries of Daily Life, Landscape'. In particular, two videographers Kim Ki-seong and Kim Seung-hyun participated together to create a collaboration work. presents. It is not a one-sided video work, but an audience participation work in which the audience expresses their daily lives through video and light. Writer Haejin Kim Due to social changes and reorganization of housing patterns, buildings are being destroyed even today and ‘new’ and ‘tall’ buildings are built in their place. Cities are developing day by day, driven by human instinct to pursue a better environment. Although it is natural for old things to disappear and new ones to come in, it is not pleasant to witness collapse, extinction, and disappearance right before our eyes. I wonder if someday the past will disappear and only the present will remain. The artist uses installations, drawings, and paintings of specific places, such as buildings that have been built, buildings with no traces of people, or rooftops, as materials. He installs them as line drawings in the space of the Schema Art Museum, and expands and completes them with the participation of the audience. It's a work of art. Author Mayumi Motojima creates works by projecting the emotions, fears, aimless anxiety, and weak psychological state inherent in humans onto a being called a ‘girl.’ However, it is by no means a ‘girl’ emotion that comes from the expression of girlish sensibility, but a more generalized and universal emotion that everyone can feel. The author is unable to express all the emotions he feels in life and tries to express the emotions he lives with. I also hope that the audience can sympathize with the emotions hidden within the formative language of ‘girl.’ Artist Lee Da-hyeon continues to look for old artifacts that embody the warmth and smell of people and feel the marks of their hands. It is not a crowded and grand place. I wanted to look at and preserve the simple lives of marginalized people, people who are not glamorous, and people including myself. The light reflection of graphite on dark paper gives off a mysterious atmosphere, and it contains a variety of visual sensations when looking at the drawing from various angles, as well as the value of an artifact that has been in contact with people's hands and feet for many years.",

He returned to Korea in early 2012 and continues his work between Korea and the United States. Taewoong Kang has constantly strived to communicate with nature during his 20 years of living in the United States, and the results have been transformed sometimes into three-dimensional forms and sometimes into various forms of flat surfaces. Looking at the titles of the works so far, they have been expressed in the series 'Dream & Daily Life', 'Vestiges', and 'Circulation', and recently, communication with nature through the 'Movement' series. is trying. In Taewoong Kang's work, gesture is one of the important elements. Various gestures leave various traces, and through the process of combining them, a new image is born. The artist's recent work, the <Movement> series, pursues harmony between the inner and outer world, yin and yang, and communication with nature through a multi-layered screen composition. The artist's <Movement>, extracted from nature, reflects everything that happens in the world. It contains the author's hope for movement in the direction of healing and positivity to restore humanity. Taewoong Kang graduated from Chung-Ang University, its graduate school, and Pennsylvania State University's Bloomsburg Graduate School, and has been working in the United States for 14 years. He returned to Korea in 2012 and has been working on his works between Korea and the United States. While exhibiting two-dimensional and three-dimensional works through 36 solo exhibitions, this exhibition will feature approximately 30 two-dimensional works that have changed since returning to Korea.

In particular, the ‘train station’, a symbol of imagination and a means to the future, that appears in this ‘Temps Magasin since 1883’ exhibition is shown as a new object created by recombining elements of four people’s imagination, objects, and memories.

This special exhibition at the Shema Museum of Art, “Memory and Imagination as New Art,” features the European artist Jusuf Hadžifejzović from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Chinese artist Cang Xin, the Japanese artist Uno Kazuyuki, and the Korean artist Lee Geon-yong. A total of six writers, including Kim Jeong-hee and Lee Myung-hwan, were invited. These six artists are descendants of the avant-garde, both in name and reality. These are artists who, from an early age, tried to create their own unique art using new materials, methods, and language to overcome the contradictions inherent in painting. The most important thing in the act of creating art is the artist's own memory and imagination. This is because, above all, an artist must have a rich artistic imagination. A true artist must always have the ability to gaze at a new world and discover and express something new, original, rich, and powerful in it. We call this the artist's imagination. For artists, the past times and traces are a treasure trove of cultivating and creating the artist's art and can be said to be an archive of his life. All of these are stored in the author's memory, and his future dreams sprout in his imagination. Memory is recalling the past, whereas imagination is dreaming of the future. Director Kim Jae-gwan said, “This exhibition aims to internationalize the area of ​​art in the Cheongju region and provides an accurate site for contemporary art to showcase the most creative and new examples of art to local artists. It is also a place for experiential art education where imagination can be expressed abundantly. “This is the goal and spirit pursued by the Schema Museum of Art,” he said.",

                explanation: "Based on Kim Yun-seop's painting research throughout 2017, this is an exhibition that presents the formal aspects of painting that artist Kim Yun-seop has been researching in the form of a report in a group exhibition and other exhibitions. Starting with 'People call these things novels', which was exhibited at Namsan House's Jeongdabang Project The Third Place, 'Artists of Tomorrow 2017' at Cheongju Museum of Art, and 'Desperate, Pessimistic, Optimistic' at Seum Art Space. The results of research into the formal aspects of painting leading up to the exhibition are displayed. This is the artist's 2017 painting-report, which presents painting in a different form from the illusionary nature of painting that was of interest until 2016. Kim Yun-seop’s solo exhibition ‘Report for Cheongju’ held at the image collector Cheongju Museum of Art is an exhibition that reports on the work of 2017 in Cheongju, when the artist found a new outlet and organized many changes in his work. The author tries many things in each work and constantly strives to break barriers. Such efforts, along with the creativity of new creations, as well as philosophical thinking to talk with visual components, magnetize the components of society and show visual results. Artist Kim Yun-seop is unique in that he did not major in traditional painting. Perhaps that is why his works feel free and sometimes seem surreal, like Jean Michel Basquiat, a representative free-concept painter of the Pop Art genre. From his work in 2009 to the present, the artist collects images from the web and works on them. The collection of images is very postmodern, but in showing them, an attempt was made to expand painting using a modernist methodology. In the 2015 painting, the illusionary nature of painting and literary elements are shown through magical realism in two-dimensional painting, and in the 2017 painting, By questioning the formality of painting and visualizing the image of objects and, further, the image of humans, these humans are once again visualized in the image of a painting, showing a still life of a human being or, more broadly, a still life of space. It does not have the compositional form of existing refined paintings. The artist, who is an image collector, exudes an overwhelming force in many ways. The story of the work created by the artist by collecting and reinterpreting it from numerous images is interesting and makes me curious and look forward to the next work.",

Each program was operated for 13 weeks/2 periods, and Toto Farm 2 involved 10 families each/a total of 50 families participated, and the dream was held at Jeungpyeong Cultural Center. In Cube 2, 2 riders/49 youths participated. Toto Farm 2 is a program that explains the location and environmental factors of the Shema Museum of Art through education. It is carried out through joint work by families participating in the program, and includes 'communication with animals', 'gardening', and 'nature art play'. Based on programs such as these, we provide a place for communication between families, and take the lead by allowing them to experience cooperation and a sense of community by learning about the overall gardening process and the joy of harvest that occurs in it, rather than simply focusing on farming. and created time for active thinking. In addition, we wanted to increase intimacy with the garden animals, build trust, create a time for emotional development and communication, and even a time for respect for life. Dream Cube 2 is a ‘cultural space created by youth themselves’ and sought to approach what type of space it would expand and utilize and create an experience space for continuous communication for youth in the region. Through the program, we aim to provide an environment to create a healthy and enjoyable Saturday for participating youth in the first to third grades of middle school, and to experience a sense of accomplishment and cooperation through program activities to become a driving force for active and positive thinking and a desirable growth process. did. Furthermore, it provided opportunities and experiences for youth to explore various career paths and grow into creative artists.",

                explanation: "This ‘Free Space’ exhibition is held under the broad theme of space (空間). ‘Family Month’ is an exhibition where family visitors and children can have fun looking at, appreciating, and thinking about ‘space’ in contemporary art. As children grow up, they dream and develop their creativity in their own space. And I think that the expression of space varies depending on the individual and the culture the child belongs to, and that something new is created in a secret space or my own space. Therefore, during May’s ‘Family Month’, it is a special exhibition that allows children to explore their creative space indefinitely with the works of six contemporary artists (Kim Hae-jin, Min Kyeong-moon, Ahn Yu-ri, Oh Wan-seok, Lee Joo-eun, and Lee Ji-yeon). You can freely move your body and thoughts in the space with the artists who participated in the exhibition, express your thoughts, and experience the process of collaborative work with your family. Artist Kim Hae-jin uses specific places as his subject matter, such as rooftops, buildings that have been built, and buildings that have disappeared with traces of people. This place, which even has a dreary energy, allows the past times to pass over to the other side. The space called ‘rooftop’ is a very strange space. In reality, it is a gray, empty space, but this space soon becomes an abstract space. Visitors can imagine what this space was like and what might happen. The theme of artist Kyungmoon Min’s private land series is ‘space.’ “Where is the most private space?” This idea created the ‘Private Land’ series. As Descartes said, “I think, therefore I exist,” human thought and spirit are the most private and complex. These thoughts are shown to us in images as complex as a maze. Artist Yuri Ahn’s ‘The Sea That Cannot Be Harvested’ is shown to the audience as a single-channel video, captured for 9 minutes in the video space. The artist created a new video as part of the <Floating Land, Floating Heart> project series, adding progress to the journey from Texel to Jeju. The author talks about 'beings that cannot be precious' and 'a heart that cannot be anchored' through several incidents that the author witnessed in the process of returning to Korea after finishing his life in the Netherlands - the Sewol Ferry and the shooting down of the Malaysian Airlines. This leads to work by reflecting on the experience. It is a work that rereads the present through mythologizing legends that feature beings who leave home and wander for a long time and eventually return home, and beings who offer prayers and rites at the places of those who left. 0188d6 Artist Oh Wan-seok's Module work is an installation work that connects small grooves to create various structures. Through the empty space of the assembled structure, viewers can experience a variety of spatial sensations and participate in the act of adding or subtracting. Myodul, in which the audience participates, will continue to create new spaces during the exhibition period. Artist Jooeun Lee’s ‘Encountering an Island on the Road’ series erases the surroundings and creates an empty landscape. The empty landscape makes us ‘watch’ or ‘wander’ at something as we move along the repeated path, and encounter fragments of contemplative images. And this is the potential landscape of everyday life. The author arranges and connects these fragments and leaves behind a journey of objects. The artist's object travel allows visitors to appreciate new spaces. Artist Jiyeon Lee began by transferring memories of space onto canvas and is currently expressing them using a variety of materials and expression methods. For the artist, expressing ~ is not simply transferring the memories of the actual space that I saw and felt into the work. It connects to a deeper imaginary story within the space.",

                explanation: "[Pung Sun-ae's non-visual movement: a project on diffusion and movement] - For her 2nd solo exhibition - Two years ago, Pung Sun-ae held a solo exhibition under the theme series 'Symbols of traces and scars drawn by the wind.' Most of the works at that time dealt with a highly emotional world organized around simple materials. And as I mentioned in the review of the solo exhibition two years ago, several contexts within his ‘world of sensibility’ were shown as ‘signified’ of the images of the work. The concept of the context can be condensed and explained in two ways, with femininity and surrealism taking center stage. Here, femininity does not mean an icon as an aesthetic symbol pursued by women today, but rather a sign of femininity in its natural meaning and the original desire of women. In addition, the silk cloth he chooses as a painting material can be said to be a ‘signifier’ that metaphorically symbolizes the artist’s mind. The silk cloth used as ‘signified’ and ‘signifier’ symbolizing ‘femininity’ and ‘surrealism’ is a representation of a very material reality, although it metaphorically indicates traces of moments that existed in time. Then, as Pung Sun-ae's impulse for a new work sprouted, she erased all the images of her work. I think it would be correct to say that it was dismantled rather than erased. Recently, artist Pung Soon-ae has been focusing on two works at the same time. The first work is an abstract expressionist painting. In Korea's modern art, abstract expressionist paintings have already been deeply related to the French abstract art movement of the 50s and 60s and American abstract expressionism, and have been very popular since the 70s. However, just as French abstractionism differs from German expressionism and Slavic abstractionism, Korean abstractionism also developed in a different style. However, it can be seen that the abstract paintings of Europe, especially France, like Engformel paintings, and their abstract paintings, which are called action paintings in the United States, were developed in a very realistic and material style. In other words, their abstractions evoke a feeling of great energy and vitality of labor through the materiality of dynamic force. However, most Korean abstract expressionist paintings are emotional and sensuous. Therefore, on the one hand, it feels very aesthetic and lyrical. In any case, Korean abstract expressionist painting has taken root as the absolute style of Korean modern art and has continued for 60 years. However, it can be seen that Pung Soon-ae's abstract expressionist paintings are very different from the common Korean abstract expressionist paintings. First, let's write down his recent work notes! “Humans move. I think art is the pattern of human life. Human patterns are diverse and our ways of living are also different. However, rules and balance coexist there. If it consists only of rules, it may be boring and confusing because it consists of the same pattern, so although there are certain rules, the shapes are different. I think this applies to social structures, human movements, patterns of life, and the spread and movement of all organisms where the human body and the world coexist. Although we all live with different patterns, sometimes we wish to share similar patterns. The pattern represents all the wishes that humans dream of, and humans move for change and longing. The heart, the pattern, the ideal, the pattern dreaming of the ideal... To express the pattern, I likened the point (sphere), the most abstract basic unit, to a human being, and expressed the movement path as a line. From nothing to something, beginning and movement. The silhouette of the overall movement expresses ideal movement, and the color represents the symbolism of the psychological state and the feeling of floating indicates that it may be an illusion, a phenomenon, or reality. The symbolic meaning of the pattern represents the aspect of repetitive patterns and the balance between regularity and irregularity. I want to express the feelings that have already been decided and predicted in the universe through irregular rules. “ Unlike other abstract artists who started from uncertain sensibilities, Pung Sun-ae’s abstract world has a very specific conceptual foundation. The ‘movement’, ‘movement’, and ‘floating’ that humans perceive he is talking about seem to be considered much more important than the human body – which may refer to oneself – not only as ‘material’ but as a ‘complex being’. Ultimately, I believe that living things exist in unity with society, culture, and the natural environment. In other words, a living entity is not only an individual characteristic of life, but also an idea viewed from an overall perspective. Another characteristic of Pung Sun-ae's paintings is that she seems to think that her imaginary worlds have no boundaries between illusion, phenomenon, and existence. David Joseph Bohm, professor of theoretical physics at University College London, said, “The entire picture is hidden in the holographic film, which appears nothing at first glance. He said, “There is an embedded order that cannot be seen directly, and this is the essence of the world.” Like a hologram, the dark world is said to be a world of essence where time and space exist in a mixed form. In our world, unlike science until now, which believed that only ‘observable reality’ is a component of matter, we are saying that an invisible world like a hologram also exists. Therefore, it is thought that the ‘movement’, ‘movement’, and ‘floating’ presented as the abstract order of Pungsoonae are the same as the ‘built-in order’ mentioned by Bohm. The new works mainly shown in this solo exhibition are works that transform abstract expression paintings into conceptual abstractions. While the abstract expressive paintings made up of overlapping brushstrokes are universal paintings and lack the uniqueness of Pung Sun-ae, the “Project on Diffusion and Movement” presented in this solo exhibition is very suitable to be introduced as Pung Sun-ae’s new painting style. It seems desirable. Countless lines and dots are spread out in a space that seems to have been cut out of mass and like an organic mass. It may be like a galaxy in the universe, or it may be like the order built into our bodies. It seems that Pung Sun-ae is beginning to see new secrets through the interconnectedness of materiality and the world of other dimensions that were not visible through her eyes and mind. He calls the route he thinks about and travels a pattern. In order to express his unique pattern, he likens the most abstract basic unit, a dot (sphere), to a human being, and expresses the movement path as a line. Just as Columbus sailed toward an unknown route, it appears to be moving through countless dots in outer space, like a spaceship outside the atmosphere. However, his paintings still rely on the senses. From now on, in order to create truly great works, Pung Sun-ae will need to understand what David Bohm's 'built-in order' is and do research on Brian R. Greene's 'structure of the universe'. . In order to reproduce this profound world in pictorial language, we must be able to approach it with mysterious digital techniques rather than simply relying on analog techniques. In short, the ‘project on diffusion and movement’ seems like a good enough theme to secure Pung Sun-ae’s future as an artist.",

The color field itself is a space where housing, livelihood, play, and rituals are condensed, divided, and juxtaposed. It is also a rite of passage in linear time from a person's birth to death. And it is a sign that reduces or simplifies the daily life of food, clothing, shelter, and the rituals of seasons and holidays that come every year. It is a formative form of the simultaneity of time in which one-time time and cyclical time are created and destroyed. The colored cotton is a structure woven with weft and warp threads. As the teachings of life, the seeds and days of the line confront each other with rejection and acceptance, and conflict with hatred and love, but form a picture where punishment and tolerance, despair and salvation are balanced at the intersection of the cross and merge into one. Patterns are a reflection of the subconscious, a product of thought, and an outpouring of wild vitality. The pattern is a symbolic symbol of a strong desire for life, and is symbolized by waves, scales, deformation of lightning patterns, or permanent waves of interference patterns, with the ripples of waves and waves extending outward. Now, the color field and pattern accept all disasters and blessings as a celebration of life, and the color field becomes a screen that becomes a rainbow flag.",

In particular, the 3rd Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition held at the Schema Art Museum will be held as an exchange exhibition between Korean and Dutch artists in Cheongju after the Korean contemporary art exhibition in The Hague, Netherlands. As we play against the Netherlands this time, we feel it once again, and we can see that Korea and the Netherlands are in a similar geopolitical environment in East Asia and Western Europe. Moreover, both countries are historically excellent people with strong traditional cultures, but because they are relatively minorities compared to neighboring powerhouses, they have suffered from numerous pressures from foreign powers. However, Korea and the Netherlands are both excellent peoples and have overcome numerous difficulties well, developing with increased pride as a nation and people that shine in the world. In particular, there is no doubt that in art history, Dutch art is the most brilliant and proud country in the world. The Netherlands is the country where the 17th century masters Rembrandt van Rijin and Vermeer were born, and it is also the country of the genius painter of modern art, Vincent Van Gogh. It is also the country that gave birth to Piet Mondrian, the master of constructivist painting, who had a great influence on 20th century art, architecture, and graphic design. In particular, the place where the “Korean Contemporary Art Exhibition – New Dream & New Future” exhibition was held is in The Haag, locally called ‘Den Haag’, a beautiful city with the meaning of ‘garden in the forest’, and a 17th-century There are numerous art museums scattered throughout the city, including the Royal Palace, the Gemeete Museum, and the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Mauritzheitz. The current capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, but it became the center of politics in 1586 when the government of the Federal Republic was established in The Hague. The Royal Palace, where the Queen of the Netherlands resides, the National Assembly, and international organizations such as the International Court of Justice are all located in The Hague. That is why embassies from around the world, including the Korean embassy, ​​are located here in The Hague, not in the capital Amsterdam. The place where our exhibition was held was ‘55 QUARTAIR’. ‘QUARTAIR’ refers to a place for production, presentation and artistic discussion. Here, QUARTAIR refers to the last period of the Ice Age, and at the same time, it has a very anthropologically sublime meaning, containing the creative meaning of the beginning of the first human being. Quatire Gallery is a place where artists who pursue the creative spirit of The Hague gather to produce works, make presentations, and have passionate discussions and discourse. Since its launch, Quatire has supported the activities, exhibitions, projects, and exchanges of artists and artists at home and abroad, while strictly avoiding linkages and cooperation with other cultures. Rather than carrying out a very tight exhibition program, we plan and assume a theoretically consistent process. The goal that Kwatai pursues is to be able to respond to the current situation of the times and to pursue a flexible program that is open to art of all diversity. Quatire is an artist's house that creates a platform for The Hague artists interested in the development of contemporary art and working in international networks. Quatire, led by young artists who recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague, was established as a non-profit corporation in 1992. This place was originally located in the Hague Bread Factory ‘H.B.F.’ and was exclusively purchased by the City of The Hague in 1902. This monumental building is managed by the Foundation B141 and houses 12 artist studios. The Quatire Gallery was remodeled in 2010 and serves as an exhibition space of 200 m2 on the first floor. Quatyre is one of the oldest functioning ‘kunstenaarsinitieven’ in The Hague. Since its launch, Quatire has supported the activities, exhibitions, projects, and exchanges of artists and artists both domestically and internationally, while strictly avoiding linkages and cooperation with other cultures. If we were to compare modern art based on the standards of Western culture, it would be difficult to compare it with Dutch art, but Korean modern art has also developed rapidly recently, producing artists who are receiving a lot of attention at the Venice Biennale and elsewhere. In particular, considering the position of Cheongju's contemporary art, not only are there a number of artists who have distinguished themselves in Tokyo, Kyoto, Beijing, Seoul, Cheongju, etc. through special exhibitions at the Schema Museum of Art, but they have also received favorable reviews in the European art world through the 'Nine Dragon Heads' project. There are quite a few writers who have received it. Just as Jessy Rahman, the co-curator of this exhibition, and I met at the special exhibition “Jump into the Unknown” at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015, director Jessy Rahman and Harold de BREE, the central artists of this Korean-Dutch exchange exhibition, both met at ‘Nine’. The fact that he is an important member of 'Dragon Heads' (CEO Park Byeong-wook) cannot be overlooked. In fact, the Schema Art Museum is making great efforts to expand the overseas expansion channels for artists in the Cheongju area, and the meeting between the Schema Art Museum and Quartair can be said to be a great fortune for us. This exhibition is also an international exchange exhibition planned as part of a strategy to promote overseas expansion of Cheongju artists and, by extension, Korean artists. After finishing in The Hague, Netherlands, an exhibition of Korean and Dutch contemporary art will be held at the Schema Museum in Korea from July 5 to July 31. This exhibition goes beyond the nature of the 3rd Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition and presents Korean contemporary art and Cheongju Contemporary in the world. It is thought that this will be a major message conveying the status of art. June 3, 2016, 4 p.m., Korean artists participating - seven writers including Sang-wook Moon, Ik-gyu Choi, Kyu-sik Lee, Eun-young Heo, Jae-nam Kim, Seung-hoe Kim, and Ki-seong Kim, as well as the author who participated as a director, co-director Jessy Rahman, and Quatire writers. , It was a wonderful opening reception put together by contemporary artists and officials from The Hague. The guests I most respect and appreciate on this day are Choi Jong-hyeon, Ambassador of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Permanent Mission to International Organizations in The Hague, and Mrs. Song Chang-ju, Director of the Lee Jun Memorial Hall, who attended the reception as the guest of honor. Even as I leave The Hague, I cannot forget the hospitality of Ambassador Choi Jong-hyun and Director Song Chang-ju. The afterimages of the images I had seen at the Hague City Art Center ‘Stroom Den Haag’, ‘Escher in Het Paleis Museum’, and ‘Panorama Mesdag Museum’ that I visited the day before leaving were not erased until I returned home. At 5 p.m. on July 5, 2016, we will again be at the Schema Art Museum in Cheongju with eight Korean artists and Dutch artists - Harold de BREE, Wieteke HELDENS, Erik-Jan LIGTVOET, Astrid NOBEL, Jessy RAHMAN, Ludmila RODRIGUES, Mike RIJNIERSE and Thom VINK hold a joint exhibition with eight others. These artists are among the top artists in Dutch contemporary art and are part of the 30 artists in residence at Quatire Studio and who work as studios in a large-scale factory measuring over 1,000 pyeong on the coast of The Hague. I think it is a very meaningful and important event for artists from The Hague to hold an exhibition in Cheongju with eight Korean artists who are doing the most innovative and creative work in Seoul at the Schema Art Museum in Cheongju. 2016 marks the 7th anniversary of the Schema Museum of Art. I believe that the “Korean-Netherlands Contemporary Art Exhibition – New dream & New Future,” held at the Schema Art Museum at the same time as the opening exhibition “The Margin of Myth” at the Cheongju Museum of Art on July 1 this year, will forever be recorded as a great step for Cheongju art.",

                explanation: "A messenger of paradise through composition and color field - Jeon Ji-yeon - It is not at all strange to think of Piet Mondrian, a painter of geometric abstract art, while looking at Jeon Ji-yeon's work. This is because Mondrian started from the everyday landscape of <Tree Series> and gradually simplified it to reach his own unique abstract formative world using only lines, planes, and colors. By omitting natural objects with only horizontal and vertical lines, he finally completed an abstract space with the most ideal proportions. Artist Jeon Ji-yeon also used the theme of <face> as a motif for her paintings from an early age. In the dictionary sense, framework refers to the texture or structure that makes up the whole of an object or organization. Jeon Ji-yeon has consistently pursued the completion of painting by conveying her message through color and form through this structure called <frame>. In the beginning, her works seemed to be very faithful to this <frame> and did not deviate significantly from the basic form of the <frame>. This is because she thought that this expressive form was the universal order of painting. In this regard, it is interpreted that at least the artist fully agreed with Piet Mondrian's artistic ideology that “painting is nothing other than proportion and balance.” In that respect, Jeon Ji-yeon's understanding and perspective on painting appears to be very conservative. The <Frame> he showed generally maintains a certain frame and form, but it is not entirely subordinate to that form, and the forms are largely connected to structural and geometric expressions. It seems clear that the artist himself probably recognized the language, or message, that he was trying to convey in the <frame> as the equivalent of painting. However, the <face> shown in her recent works is very beautiful and free. This trend is evaluated as the artist's free will or change in not being bound by the concept and form of <frame>. As far as <frame> is concerned, anywhere, “there is no stubborn form, no attachment, no closure.” There is no distinction between inside and outside, and there is no weight. Therefore, it symbolizes that the artist has settled into the most free state where he can meet anything and throw away anything. Perhaps she was thinking of the concept of Tao that the Eastern philosopher Lao Tzu had? No, I would have thought so. Lao Tzu said in the Tao Te Ching that the Taoist Way is a non-uniform way. If you say it is already “Tao,” it means it is no longer “Tao.” Her interests range from lines and surfaces, flat surfaces and three-dimensional works, and she built her own formative language by drawing color bands through surface division and adding color to various geometric shapes. At times, Jeon Ji-yeon's style is completed with sharply angled shapes, cutting out gentle lines and soft surfaces, and using cheerful colors. In a screen created with balance and stubborn rules, contrasting shapes communicate with intelligent and elegant colors, boldly demonstrating the state of dramatic harmony that a flat surface can show. The images sometimes look like “the world seen from above,” but they are also like “the world seen from the side” or “the secret story of the inside,” condensing the story of an intelligent artist that boils down to his own story. The artist has defined this type of artistic creation and work process as “an act of healing and comfort.” The work of this artist, who gives the impression of being a devout Christian, must be closely related to his own message. I'm curious about that. However, what I am still certain about in Jeon Ji-yeon's work is that the process of painting will have the same meaning and value as the “act of praying.” If you agree to view Jeon Ji-yeon's work from that perspective, the works at the Shema Museum of Art should be called the answer and result of a transcendent prayer to the agony. The response serves as a sign that she has safely landed in El Dorado, a sublimated color field and composition that is a step forward from the <frame> she has been honing and refining. Therefore, we must continue to pay attention to the flow of color field and composition that she displays. Now, the key question is ultimately what message these works are giving us. Moreover, when her message is abstract, its interpretation may be more difficult or even impossible. Perhaps, as the aesthetician Wilhelm Bohringer observed, abstract art is an important form of conveying empathy. In this way, it seems clear that all of Jeon Ji-yeon's art fundamentally starts from some internal impulse and relationship. Although it is impossible to clearly explain the artistic impulse and its inevitable relationship, it is also reckless to try to interpret the painting as if it were all the reason and result. The artist once confessed in an interview that her paintings encompass these messages, from “family and everyday relationships to nature, the absolute, and my inner relationship.” However, the characteristic and subtle charm of Jeon Ji-yeon's paintings is that such relationships do not appear in direct and concrete expressions in her works. If so, it is assumed that her paintings are an art of metaphorical language that captures inner consciousness through color and form. For example, the traces of that life are sometimes combined into cold shapes, elegant colors, small bands, and irregular structures on the screen. The secret harmony of colors and forms achieved in this way gives us an abundance of unchanging visual pleasure, and his pictorial message is full of intellectual and religious sublimity. I pay great attention to the dramatic expression of color and form in which she innovatively breaks free from the framework without abandoning the framework. This is because as the framework is simplified into an abstract form, her ability to create division and composition of color fields is doubled without hesitation. Of course, just as the artist, like Malevich, thirsted for abstract forms that no longer exist on earth, he will continue to sail through the geometric sea, drawing colors such as circles, squares, and triangles. In addition, we will reach the orderly artistic quality of Serge Poliakov's outstanding composition using lines and colors, which are still the fundamental formative elements of painting. Just as Mondrian's intellectual exploration of the basic forms of nature presented a new path to the world of art, his <Frame> will show the highest formative beauty of painting and bring about the possibility of another three-dimensional work. Thus, by dividing the screen in a more orderly manner through abstraction and formalizing emotions, the artist's mission, the essence of the message, will be reached. The reason why this metaphor of Jeon Ji-yeon's visual expression is possible is because the artist does not follow art trends that much. She constantly asks questions about painting, confirming her existence through purely geometric forms and colors. It would be lonely to always fill the canvas with your own message like this. Expanding the realm of expression into three-dimensional work, which she had briefly shown interest in on that lonely pilgrimage, seems to be an oasis beyond El Dorado for her. Although it appears to be a deviation from the stereotypical two-dimensional painting, it is an overcoming and allows for the diversification of expression. Artist Jeon Ji-yeon basically reveals the inner landscape she perceives in a vague way at times and captures it in a somewhat unbalanced structure and form. Therefore, the series of <Flat> always gives us freedom and does not force us, so it is free and intellectually cultured. Sometimes, the visual proportions of space make us breathe, the aura of color makes us silent, and the comfortable unfolding of forms makes us look back on traces of existence. We too often abandon our precious inner landscape and relationships. We live buried in reality, losing beautiful moments. Jeon Ji-yeon's paintings constantly probe and intensely visualize the way relationships exist in the intimate scenes of human life, and above all, they have a fatal charm as paintings. Isn't the true beauty, power, and vitality of art that we can have such joy of life and intellectual reflection in an artist's work?",

                explanation: "The Aspect Contemporary Art Association held its first exhibition in 1988. Afterwards, in 2000, the name was changed to Hui Aspect. The meaning was to end the new millennium and open a post-era era based on the founding spirit of Aspect. In 2013, a special exhibition celebrating the 25th anniversary of Later Aspects was held at the Daecheongho Art Museum. So Aspect’s history spans 28 years. As 2018 marks 30 years of history, it is no exaggeration to say that “Aspect” has led the history of Cheongju’s contemporary art. To that extent, the Post-Aspect exhibition has important value in the history of Korean contemporary art. I believe that this exhibition “Buzzed Boundaries” is the term that most concisely describes the zeitgeist of the 21st century. The diverse formative beauty shown in contemporary art blurs the boundaries of genres, and experimental paintings and sculptures cross each other's fields and steadily produce new formative beauty. Most of the ‘Lost Aspect Contemporary Art Association’, which is actively leading the contemporary art scene, is comprised of artists who have built their own worlds of work within this trend and are actively exhibiting not only in Korea but also overseas. The 2016 Postaspect Exhibition was held at the Schema Museum of Art, a leader in contemporary art in Cheongju. Under the theme of 'Buzzed Boundaries', 25 artists broke down the boundaries of genres, looked at contemporary art while standing at the boundaries, and thought about and communicated with the boundaries. It will be a meaningful exhibition where you can see the trends and trends of modern art by showcasing a variety of works with pictorial imagination.",

At first, about 10 members were formed and worked as a member group for contemporary art research through text study. However, as the number of member artists spread to Seoul, Cheongju, Incheon, Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, and Chungju, the academy's operating pattern was converted to a workshop format. So far, we have had member exhibitions in Seoul (Space Ham Gallery), Namwon (Songwon Gallery), Cheongju (Shema Art Museum), Asan (Danglim Art Museum), and Jindo (Jangjeon Art Museum). Of course, each member has been actively engaged in exhibitions at home and abroad, and the quality of their work has also improved considerably. We hope that this exhibition will be a new form of membership exhibition that has been greatly transformed and developed. The theme of this exhibition, “Shema Initiative Exhibition – Pathway to Thought,” is the word “INITIATIVE,” meaning that each member has his or her own language and takes the lead in the form of work. There will be differences between senior members and new members, but we want to make this an enjoyable exhibition where each member can fully demonstrate their individual initiative.",

Since 2009, artist Seo Yun-hee has shown her unique world of work using stains and smudges on paper under the large theme of the gap of memories. In particular, this exhibition will show the artist’s ‘Gap of Memory’ work on the Gap of Memory held in Cheongju’s Bulat Village. Artist Seo Yoon-hee's unique working method is to express traces of life through stains that appear by steaming drawing paper with water steeped in various herbs, teas, etc. that she found herself, then drying the paper and repeating the process several times. The artist takes out the memories accumulated throughout her life one by one and grafts them onto the space created through a process that can be said to require extreme patience. Through this work, the artist visualizes the gaps in the image by featuring anonymous people he meets in his daily life and people who remain in his memory. The Korean materials that can be easily found in our lives, such as medicinal herbs and tea, chosen by the author, play a role in disinfecting and revitalizing wounds buried in memories. The work of creating various types of stains is the result of the activity of time, leaving behind a accumulation of time like a natural landscape. Artist Seo Yoon-hee's work in Bulat Village will be exhibited as an 8m installation, a new video work, and a two-dimensional work. I am looking forward to seeing what kind of memory gaps will be shown on the coincidentally shaped paper made in the village of Bulat.",

In this ‘Hello Pattern!!’ exhibition, audiences will be able to discover the stories hidden behind colorful patterns and approach the works as enjoyable and fun art rather than arcane and difficult art. In addition, the 'Hello Pattern!!' exhibition and program is intended to more actively reach out to general visitors who find art difficult, and to allow children in Cheongju City and the Schema Museum of Art to enjoy more diverse and fresh cultural benefits.

                explanation: "Dream Of Hanok – Dream Of Flower Discovery of the primordial formative beauty of binary opposition The Schema Museum of Art planned the ‘Contemporary Art, 6 Artists’ exhibition in 2015 to introduce six artists active in Gwangju. The six artists are in their 50s or so and distributed across the country, each with a different and unique style of work. They are artists who have been actively presenting their works both domestically and internationally since 2014. The works of the 'Six Artists, Hall of Contemporary Art' exhibition are designed to create new visual art in the direction of various contemporary art by researching and constructing one's own world of work even in the 21st century modern domestic and international environment that is too poor for the development of culture and art. It's showing. From the perspective of art history in the 21st century, artist Geum Kyeong-bo considers purity and autonomy as the main issues of modern art, a formative activity that has changed in various ways from the perspective of art history in the 21st century. By finding the linear formativeness felt in the form of an object and drawing it with abstract expression, the artist draws with a given situation and I develop my work by reinterpreting emotions in my own way. Artist Mihyo Kim's work depicts psychological phenomena using the supernatural power of the universe and the waves of color. It contributes to creating a sustainable alternative society by maintaining a harmonious life between humans and nature and creating a village community where humans are organically linked based on the basic ideology of the Indramang Life Community that all things in the universe are “one body, one life.” They are expressing hope and love while seeking ‘Indramang’ for the purpose of. Artist Oh Na-kyung fills the surface of Arches with oil pastels or oil bars and repeats the process of painstakingly scraping them off. The shape that appears on the screen through a long process of painting and scratching appears to be the shape of some kind of animal. This is a form seen in the innocent and fresh eyes of children, and the honest appearance and expression of objects brings different shapes to mind for each viewer, and these shapes appear in the form of life for both the artist and the viewer. In artist Lee Dong-seok's work, what can be seen in a movie that progresses in time is simultaneously shown on the screen. This does not guide the viewer's perspective based on a geometric control device that corresponds to traditional Western visual art, nor does it adjust to a vanishing point that subordinates all details of the image to a single point of view, so the audience is able to control their psychology through the physical process. It allows the visual act to be experienced as a physiognomic process. For artist Lee Min-gu, the most basic elements that form the basis of his work can be summarized in two keywords: ‘non-commercial purity’ and ‘indulgence in materials.’ Looking at the current situation where market-oriented commercial art is rampant and many artists who endlessly repeat self-replication are mistaking the act of self-reproduction as if it were the artist's identity, we can see the spirit of non-commercial purity and exploration of materials. Lee Min-gu's serious and consistent attitude, which seeks intense creation and insight into art through a critical view of reality and constant communication with the public, clearly has significant implications for artists. Artist Jang Min-jeong's work does not tell the entire reality of what is shown. The reality of things shown is not whether they exist or not, but how much meaning they contain. The interpretation of the meaning is attempted by the viewer to interpret it in the context of the person's situation. Just as when our eyes see an image, we do not see the reality but feel an illusion... the reality dazzles our eyes and sometimes causes illusions. As if that were all... These works will be presented in this exhibition as a new story by tying them together under the theme of ‘窓’, which shows another aspect of modern art.",

                explanation: "Dream Of Hanok – Dream Of Flower Discovery of the primordial formative beauty of binary opposition Artist Hanwoo Lee is an artist who has worked in an original way without staying within the boundaries of traditional art, insisting on the protoplasm of life using terracotta, the most natural method in sculpture. . In particular, he has created new formative beauty through various experiments and consistent methods of expression through terracotta works that reflect primordial life and Korean emotions, along with a work method that explores the beauty of humanity that embraces the most Korean scent and earthy scent. This solo exhibition, which reflects this inner world, exhibits works simultaneously at the Jeollabuk-do Provincial Office Outdoor Plaza and Jeonju Rubelbaek Gallery under the theme of Hanok. At the provincial office outdoor plaza, an outdoor sculpture garden exhibition will be held featuring the works of “Dream Of Hanok,” and at the Rubelbeck Gallery, an exhibition with the scent of earth will be held with the theme of “Dream Of Flower,” containing formative images of the most Korean flowers. In particular, this exhibition is divided into exhibitions that combine the appropriate use of external space and internal space with works in which Korean sentiment is linked to his work consciousness, which shows his artistic ability and the energy of his work consciousness. The beautiful lines of Hanok and the vital aesthetic of flowers shown in masterpieces and props complete the Korean sensibility that reflects life in external landscape images and internal space. In addition, he creates a friendly atmosphere unique to Hanok, and the sublime beauty emanating from flowers can be felt at the peak of emotion through his works. This can be seen as a characteristic of incorporating simple aesthetics that concisely summarizes the formative characteristics of Hanok and flowers through the natural connection of life through the use of internal and external space. Artist Lee Han-woo's insight into his work can be discussed for its borrowing from the pillars of the Hanok architectural style. The vertical pillar form of the work uses the form that is close to the natural form of a Hanok pillar. Based on the image of completing a Hanok by peeling only the bark from a tree and erecting the form as is on the pillar, a shape that merges in the protoplasm of the work with his mental world. The formative environment surrounding the artist is consistent with the scenery of his studio, which is steeped in the pure stains of time and space that have been devoted to clay for a long time. The passion of his work in such a studio is not a visual image seen with the eyes, but the passion of the inner soul felt with the heart. The works are created as crystals of sweat mixed with beauty in the flame, and the life breathes. He completes the work by adding artistic imagination from the space. On this basis, his perspective on the work does not insist on the original appearance of the hanok, and the object does not simply remain in the shape that occupies space, but creates the work in the simple beauty of balance and harmony. The process of going out, especially the hanok-themed atmosphere of Jeonbuk, is symbolically shown. In particular, through the rediscovery of Hanok, which artistically restrains the unique sensuous intuition and emotion of Hanok and emphasizes the technique of martial arts, the work is heated and hardened in a kiln, utilizing the unique taste of life and soil, and the coloring of iron oxide is used. By combining it, it has a rugged weight and a unique sense of its own. This is a very important fact, and based on this recognition, the work with the theme of Hanok is based on curiosity about protoplasm, grasps the materials and spatial form without difficulty within the basic framework implied by Hanok, and assigns a specific development method. In addition, in a process that flows like water with the flow of time and the naturalness of space, it goes beyond the simple reproduction of nature and the artist, and shows the most familiar aspects of daily life through visual images that are integrated with Korean sensibilities. “Dream Of Hanok” exquisitely adds modern formative beauty to realize the logic of the universe unified with Hanok through a formative process that observes and expresses the external and structural characteristics shown in the natural flow of touch and patterns, and creates an unbiased They are demanding to be seen as they are. “Dream Of Flower,” exhibited at the Rubelbeck Gallery, brings to mind a solid formative image momentarily frozen in the midst of countless dynamic flows converging in one place. The most Korean human scent, which transforms the life of a flower into an abstract image of a dream, provides a sense of space and life at the same time. “Dream Of Flower” goes beyond a simple flower, which is a metaphor for the aesthetic value of humans before the visual beauty of flowers, and reduces it to the space and formative transformation of another world, an eternal and immortal flower that overcomes the physiology of a flower that blooms and dies for a brief moment. This work seeks to embody the author's own dream monologue. Artist Lee Han-woo's immersion in the work and formative concerns for countless hours are combined with the coloring technique of iron oxide pigments applied to the appearance of the clay composite expressed in the work, as well as the formative work that assimilates and blooms with pure natural colors in the process of long firing under a blazing fire. It is completed as a work of meditation and healing that captures the aesthetics of life born with fire filled with red flowers and at the same time allows for deep thinking and communication. The formative solidity and shape blooming in endless overlapping space maximizes the inner vitality of the flower, and on the background of the heavy color of iron oxide, one can experience the energy of dream life in an organic landscape. Yanagi Muneyoshi (柳宗悅, 1889-1961) said, ‘An invisible, infinite external force allowed them to create beauty.’ In other words, the works of artist Lee Han-woo's current solo exhibition “Dream Of Hanok” – “Dream Of Flower” are a process of mixing together the two aspects of finding the inner Korean archetype, combining the breath of earth and the fundamental power of his work and Hanok. It is a manifestation, and it talks about the sensibility that embraces a millennium-old story that embraces the time and space that specifically and accurately analyzes and communicates the stories of modern humans and life, as well as works born from tradition. This solo exhibition by artist Lee Han-woo, who has recreated and translated the timeless beauty of Hanok and the aesthetics of flower life into works, conveys the message of the artist's dreams through the harmonious combination of a style with the modern urban landscape through terracotta works. It is being reincarnated and transmitted within. His work, which reinterprets and embodies Jeonbuk's traditional Korean houses that have matured with time in a landscape under the sky where people and nature coexist, is a binary opposition between formativeness and pictoriality, and modernity and tradition. It is equipped with traditional elements, and the formativeness shown in the work is clear, and you can get a glimpse of the purity that is extracted by refining the essence of Hanok and the shape of Korean flowers. When artist Lee Han-woo's soul blooms in the soil filled with natural water and wind, you will be able to feel the Korean sensibility and the aesthetics of the harmony of tradition and modernity in your heart in his work.",

                explanation: "In 2015, the Schema Museum of Art is planning an exhibition called “Dots, Lines, and Planes, Let’s Play!” that the whole family can enjoy together during May’s ‘Family Month’. The exhibition ‘Dots, Lines, and Planes, Let’s Play!’ is a kind of exhibition that shows the perspectives on points, lines, and planes of various genres and experts, including artists, architects, film directors, and theater actors, using the basic unit of ‘points, lines, and planes.’ As a multi-purpose exhibition, it is an audience-participatory exhibition in which participating artists directly produce and display their works, and the exhibition is completed through the participation of visitors. In the basic unit of 'point, line, surface', 'point' is the basic unit of formative design that only has position, and includes the number of points, the location of the point, the brightness of the point, the size of the point, the material for drawing the point, and the relationship with other points. Depending on the shape, movement, and space, it can convey a unique feeling. A ‘line’ is a basic formative element formed by a series of dots and has a position and direction. Lines made from dots can express various thoughts and emotions, and changes in the thickness of the lines give a sense of humor and movement. A ‘face’ is a surface formed by overlapping several lines, and can be said to be a flat surface inside the boundary line surrounded by lines. Although the surface itself does not have depth, it is possible to give the feeling of space or three-dimensionality by adding color effects to the surface. You can also create a new surface by dividing a given space or overlapping two or more surfaces. Artists participating in this exhibition include Kim Young-mi, who worked with dots, lines, and planes in miniatures, Kim Seo-yeon, who worked on dots in geometric abstraction, Kim Hye-jin, who found dots, lines, and planes in installation art, and dots and lines in drawings. Artist Kim Hyeong-gon showing planes, artist Lee Lee showing dots, lines, and planes shown in performance, architect Lee Soon-pyo showing dots, lines, and planes in architecture through installation works, and video of dots, lines, and planes appearing in body movements. Actor Jo Deok-jae, who shows dots, lines, and planes in paintings, artist Myung-hwa Chung, who shows dots, lines, and planes in paintings, film director Jeong Yun-seop, who shows dots, lines, and planes in writing, video, and scenarios, and team Dihamun (who shows dots, lines, and planes in hair art) Through the various works of hair artists Park Gong-ju, Choi Eun-kyung, and Hyeon-tae, it will be an exhibition that provides a glimpse into the changes in basic units that were once thought to be simple and the various thoughts of participating artists. In addition, this exhibition hopes that you will experience the fun of appreciating the expressive areas and paintings that can be expressed with points, lines, and planes by looking at works that artists approach from the point, line, and plane, the basic units of art. We plan to actively conduct audience participation programs that encourage exhibition visitors to think creatively in relation to dots, lines, and planes. The purpose of this exhibition is to more actively reach out to visitors who find art difficult, and it is also an exhibition to knock on the doors of thought for children in areas where they receive less cultural benefits than children in big cities.",

                explanation: "Concluding the 6th anniversary of the opening of the Schema Museum of Art [Coexistence and Sympathy of the Times Exhibition] What kind of era is ours? What is the most important issue for us now? British futurist Dr. Peter Peel said: “The most important thing we need to do at this time is how will our future change in the next 20, 50 years? “It’s about thinking about it.” I think this means that rather than focusing on the present, it is very important to worry about the future that may occur in one generation or later. I think the same is true for modern art. Rather than rushing to imitate styles that already exist, I think we should focus on new art that allows us to think about the future. Not only in Korea but also in the world, abstract art took the lead after the end of World War II 70 years ago. Of course, after Romanticism emerged as a reaction to classicism in the 18th century, a new concept of art that emphasized self-expression emerged, and ‘style’ gradually became an issue. Since then, art has gone through the emergence of various styles and formats, and following the emergence of Dadaism and avant-garde art, it is thought that it has undergone even more innovative changes and reached what it is today. However, it seems that art in the late 20th century is facing another dilemma and calling for another change. With the emergence of avant-garde art and conceptual art, the status of art was qualitatively improved through research into the essence of art, but as another effort was needed to restore modern art that had become distant from the public, the gallery era opened, and the global art market expanded at home and abroad. Although the art market has regained vitality in the era of the 'art fair' boom, it cannot be denied that other negative effects are occurring. A phenomenon occurred in which overly commercialized paintings clouded the public's eyes and caused the loss of creativity, the absolute value inherent in art. The 56th Venice Biennale, which opened on May 9 and is still running, has many implications for today's contemporary art. Although I also participated as a Korean artist commissioner for this Biennale’s special exhibition “Jump into the Unknown,” the Biennale does not imitate classics or reproduce past trends, but allows new thoughts and language to be presented as one’s own unique creations. You can see that it exists. That is why the modern art world needs museums and art groups that pursue creative art, such as museums and residencies. Currently, every country in the world can be said to be in the era of art museums. Therefore, public and private art museums that pursue new art in our region, Cheongju Creation Studio, and Hive can be said to be public institutions that play a very important role for the future of Cheongju art. The Schema Museum of Art will celebrate its 6th anniversary on June 26th of this year. It seems like only yesterday that the opening exhibition was held in 2009, but six years have already passed. In the meantime, we have been consistently planning exhibitions that attract a lot of attention, such as one or two international exchange exhibitions every year, invitation exhibitions for local art groups, network exhibitions with the Cheongju International Craft Biennale, creative education through children's art experiences, and special exhibitions for local specialization projects. We have held special exhibitions of our collections several times in the past, but this time, to mark our 6th anniversary, we would like to hold a special exhibition of our collections under the title of ‘Coexistence and Sympathy of the Times.’ We expect this to be a great opportunity to empathize with the meaning of coexistence in our time through the diverse language of fine art.",

                explanation: "C, A Fidlar, the dual sign of perception and representation in Yoo Seok-gyu's work, said, “What is called artistic activity only means the activity of a plastic artist.” He also said, “In general, art does not exist in only one form. “It exists as various forms of art, and a work of art is something that appears in the sensory life or mental situation of a human being.” Through these words, artistic activities are made up of the nature of each artist, and art is the human being as an organism. It shows that mental and physical phenomena were separated through artistic activities and underwent developmental changes. However, humans have existed as symmetrical beings with objects. Relatively, an object as a symmetrical human being cannot become an object of perception just by being there until it is determined to be an object of art. This is because the object itself cannot be a mental possession. Ultimately, the object means that various actions occur through the organism called human beings. Through consciousness about things, humans form their own actions and express them as possessions of consciousness. Art is something that is accepted by those who possess the abilities of sense and perception. Originally, objects are a world that exists and humans are a world that perceives and represents, and an antagonistic relationship is established between the two. In the end, the relationship between objects and humans is a position that sees two types of things, “what is known” and “what is known.” On the one hand, the dichotomy between “knowing” and “what is known” is unified. Therefore, we wonder how we came to recognize the fact that our overall consciousness of reality actually depends on perception. This recognition means that humans are fulfilling the role of understanding the full picture of various mental relationships regarding reality, and it ultimately appears in a high-dimensional field called abstract thinking. In other words, the question of the absolute existence of an object is not given directly, but is the product of the artist's highly developed abstract thinking. Artist Yoo Seok-gyu's work shows that he is creating his own unique world of work by asking philosophical questions about his own work about the reproduction of objects, humans, objects, and images through questions about the absolute existence of objects. You can. Seok-gyu Yoo admits that right after graduating from college, there was a time when he felt deep skepticism about drawing. Many young artists experience the same concerns, and Yoo Seok-gyu was passing through this period mainly by erasing paintings as a sign of rejection of image production or working with a critical view on the art system itself. From a technical perspective, his work includes 'erasing' other people's drawings with sandpaper or white paint and a 'black screen' series that covers certain parts of the screen. These are made up of a variety of media, including photography, video, and two-dimensional painting. You can clearly read a cross-section of his negative thoughts about painting in the works of this period. The two series, which can be divided into paintings and video media, seem unrelated at first glance because they are not related in content, but they can be said to be works along the same line in that they criticize issues related to image production and distribution and the art system itself. As his first work, the series of works based on other people's works can be seen taking a slightly different approach by 'appropriating painting as a space for confronting other people (objects) rather than as a space for private expression.' It seems that this is recognized as an innovative method that can make a difference from other painting works. In this way, Yoo Seok-gyu raises questions about the standards of painting through his paintings and tries to differentiate them from the works of other artists through these questions about paintings. Ultimately, his work has two authors within it. In this series of works, the person who drew the previous work co-exists in some form, and it seems that this is helpful in establishing the status of the audience and the artist himself horizontally. It can be seen that his recent works seek to symptomatically reveal modern accumulation, inherent violence, and potential danger that run counter to disconnection, death, and coexistence. Examples include the 'Roadkill (Road to Cheonggye)' series and the 'One-Man Protest' works, where the artist, as the winner of the discourse of the times, uses the straight road, a symbol of speed ideology, as a material to provide convenience and space to humans. It provides a connection, but as a result, the straight road becomes a violent straight line, triggering disconnection and death. In fact, the recent works have nothing to do with the previous works other than being drawn on top of them, and only combine the previous works with later images in a montage. He seems to be thinking that what kind of text the two combinations will form may not be up to the artist, but rather the autonomy created by the painting itself or a matter outside the work. This idea is very similar to the concept of difference and the properties of montage presented by Derrida. They seem to have a close relationship. In Yoo Seok-gyu's work, the formative or textual disintegration takes place and the partial bodies become fragmented and undergo a separation process, showing the process of collapse of the cogito, logos, circulation of structure, and presence of action. For him, blatant acceptance of intertextuality and a self-reflective attitude seem to be an inevitable confession rather than a choice. A series of such attempts in Yoo Seok-gyu's works appear to be intended to promote 'horizontal confrontation' by creating a kind of space of pleasure, but from an aesthetic standpoint, a dichotomy between 'verbal' and 'visual' inevitably arises. do. In contemporary art, paintings are often interpreted from the perspective of a challenge to symbolic authority that arises from the clash of signifiers using montage. In the case of Yoo Seok-gyu, the verbal element is called 'signifié' and the visual element is 'iconic'. Although it can be distinguished by 'signifier', it can be found that it is ultimately fused and overlapped to form a single work. Yoo Seok-gyu himself reveals that the series of works showing an ambivalent attitude toward images in his paintings is an attempt to divert painting into a space for confronting others rather than a space for private expression. The most unique features of his paintings can also be found here. Generally, paintings start on a white canvas, but these works are not newly created works on a blank screen, but are based on objects that already exist, such as discarded paintings, paintings passed on by other artists, and the artist's own old paintings that feel too unfamiliar. These are things. Through this series, we can get a glimpse of the artist's strategy to create differences in aesthetic experience by intervening in the traditional artist's status along with a slightly different proposal for painting, and to reorganize the interrelationships between the artist and the viewer and the artist and the work more horizontally. In Yoo Seok-gyu's previous works, it is easy to mistakenly perceive them as background scenery as they refer to paintings from a physical standpoint. However, if you look closely, this has a very important meaning that suggests the basic characteristics of the symbol system, and it has an ambiguity in that it appears to have an independent meaning or appears to be related to each other in a chain, and this ambiguity is an important part of his work. This can be said to be another characteristic. For example, the erased image of the previous work is a uniquely silent object that only testifies to the time of the image that 'once existed'. Although its own time and history may be rich, it has an inaccurate ambiguity and even appears to be deceptive. . Here, reading two images in one spatial structure seems to have the opposite benefit of making the ambiguity of overlapping meanings more noticeable. This technique is often applied in films that produce meaning emphasized by the intersection between the signifier and the signified. By hiding the signified behind its functionality as a signifier, it has the effect of recognizing the gap in time more clearly than the gap in space. You will have To conclude, the potential ambiguity of the images provided in Yoo Seok-gyu's works is due to the film's unity being equalized through the combination of images, like the overlapping expression of one continuous image and another image along a diachronic axis. As in this case, we see that ambiguity is being removed. His 'series based on other people's paintings' works are classified into 'passive intervention' and 'active intervention', and the works using erasing techniques are referred to as 'passive intervention', but 'Fruit with Fruit' appears to be his early work. When comparing “Still Life” with “Still Life with Books,” which appears to be a recent work, we see that the active erasing work in the previous work actually strengthens physical reality as ambiguity expands, and there is relatively more room for audience intervention. However, as can be seen in the recent works “Flower Pot” and “Mountain”, the form of the work is changing as the screen changes from the erasing work of the previous work to the overpainting work. His recent works, which he classifies as 'active intervention', 'Road to Cheonggyecheon' and 'One-Man Protest', are the artist's intervention rather than simply a record of the scene of an incident, and 'Lovers Who Became Stars' is an image that changes symbolically, rather than a record of it. I think conversationality can be interpreted as recovery. In particular, the modern agglomeration seen in the recent works “Guardrail” and “White castle” is an urban concept that is in line with the desire of capital and can be said to aim for efficiency and selfishness rather than compromise and coexistence. The work “On modern agglomeration” Through a dog facing death, it seeks to express contradictory impressions about the distorted accumulation that underlies Korean society. For example, White Castle, which depicts a nuclear power plant, looks like a white castle on the beach, but the desire and fearsome danger inherent in this object ironically expresses a visual contradiction that goes well with the beautiful surrounding scenery. In this way, we see that Yoo Seok-gyu is doing a very arduous task of expressing the dual phenomenon of social contradictions and distorted reality caused by civilization from a new perspective. However, his persistent pictorial interpretation of the ambiguity and flatness of paintings arising from the flat structure, which can be said to be the most important feature and handicap of two-dimensional paintings, is rather interestingly recorded as a dual sign of perception and representation in his paintings.",

It's so short that I'm embarrassed to show it to others. I live by the dog shit philosophy. I get worried every time I display a work of art. Could it be that through my work, I am teaching someone a lesson, leading them to my will, or even unknowingly forcing something distorted about me? worried! I just want to have at least some honest encounters with others through my work. When I am honest, they sometimes come up to me and talk honestly. I don't want my work to look hypocritical, embellished, extremely high-level, or amazing. I just hope that others can easily come into my child-like, raw and immature childhood and share their life stories with me openly.

It will be a good exhibition that can amplify the event concept of Biennale 2015. The reason is that it was in the 20th century that isms and forms emerged in earnest in art history. Additionally, artists exhibited in this exhibition include Picasso, Chagall, Bernard Buffet, Fernando Leger, Francis Bacon, Lichtenstein, Modigliani, Antony Tapies, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Raphael Soto, Barnett Newman, Joan Miró, and César. This is because the artists who created unique forms of work are evaluated as the most brilliant artists of the 20th century. Not only modern art, but all art is even greater because it expands and coexists with their artistic spirit and form. Many writers born in the post-war generation humbly learn the fruits of the noble spirit and values ​​that blossomed from the frustration and agony of these 20th century masters. This exhibition, held at the Shema Museum of Art as part of the Eco Biennale of the 2015 Cheongju International Craft Biennale, was organized by the Shema Museum of Art with the support of Professor Kim Jong-geun, an art critic and representative of ‘Art Blue.’ As the main exhibition of the Cheongju International Craft Biennale, the “Breath of 20th Century Masters” exhibition is an exhibition that accompanies local art museums as a fine art exhibition, providing another opportunity for appreciation to local artists, the general public, and visitors to Cheongju. I think it's a great exhibition.",

                explanation: "The 2nd Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition 『After the 1990s Taemong · Truewood Era, About the Present of Korean-Japanese Contemporary Art』 This exhibition is held as part of the 2nd International Contemporary Art Exhibition, but the exhibition contents are 『90s Taemong · Truewood Period and Afterwards』 This exhibition is held as part of the 2nd International Contemporary Art Exhibition. I started with the topic, “About the current state of Korean and Japanese beauty.” This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Korean government after the end of the war and the signing of the diplomatic agreement that settled the complicated past between Korea and Japan and started a new friendly relationship between the two countries. Since liberation, the Korean people have made countless efforts to overcome the cultural harm caused by Japanese invasion and domination, but on the other hand, they cannot overlook Japan's economic revival, which has been developing at an alarming rate after the end of the war. Although the circumstances are different, both Korea and Japan come under the militarily control of the United States, and their political structures change to model themselves on Western democracy. This phenomenon continues to this day, but the economic environment in Korea was such that poverty was inevitable as the country experienced the Korean War. However, Japan ironically benefited from the Korean turmoil and grew into the world's second largest economy. I don't want to mention it again, but during the Japanese colonial period, Korea went through the humiliation of having many of its traditional cities dismantled, the use of the Korean alphabet banned, and even having its own name changed to a Japanese name as it was forced to change its family name by a decree of the Government General of Korea, resulting in 36 years of colonial rule. There was an era. There are many other shameful facts, but I will omit them and focus on the meaning of this exhibition. In the early 20th century, Joseon's modern art began with the 'Joseon Art Exhibition' organized by the Japanese Government General, but after liberation, modern art developed under the influence of both Western art and Japanese contemporary art. After Lee Jung-seop and Park Soo-geun, Korean modern art developed rapidly while simultaneously being influenced by Western Informel, Abstract Expressionism, and Japanese Monoha. Since the early 1980s, Korean contemporary art has faced a new turning point thanks to new contemporary art movements such as Park Seo-bo, Jeong Chang-seop, and Ha Jong-hyeon, but on the other hand, people's art that resists military dictatorship has emerged. As it progresses, it develops in a different way. Young artists advance to Paris, New York, etc. and accept new Western contemporary art, but on the other hand, as they advance to Tokyo, the contemporary art of the Dansaekhwa movement emerges, leading to active exchanges between Korean and Japanese contemporary art. . At this time, exhibitions by Korean artists were frequently held at the Tokyo Gallery, Kamakura Gallery, Ueda Gallery, and Muramatsu Gallery, but on the other hand, the Kanda area of ​​Tokyo was held frequently. Active exchanges also took place at Tamura Gallery, Maki Gallery, and Komai Gallery, where the youth art movement was actively developing. These galleries became the base for youth art in Japan at that time, and the representative of these galleries was art critic Nobuo Yamagishi. Artist Lee Ufan, a pioneer of Monoha currently active in Japan, also had a special relationship with Yamagishi, and was the center stage of the activities of major Japanese young artists, even having an exhibition at the Tamura Gallery at one time. Shinju Yamamoto, Kazunori Takeuchi, Hiroshi Takeda, Kayano Morimoto, and Osamu Kushida are participating in this exhibition. 、Igawa Seiryo ( Those who are currently leading figures in Japanese contemporary art, such as Kazuyuki Uno, Masami Yoshioka, etc., are also representative artists who were active here in the 80s and 90s. The first time I met Mr. Yamagishi was at Haneda Airport in February 1981. At that time, I met Yamagishi through the introduction of my alma mater, Professor Ha Jong-hyeon, and had my first solo exhibition at the Komai Gallery. At the same time, Kim Tae-ho's solo exhibition was held at the Maki Gallery and Ji Seok-cheol's solo exhibition was held at the Tamura Gallery, and the Tokyo Exhibition of a young Korean artist was featured in the Tokyo Shimbun. It became an issue in the Tokyo art world to the extent that it was even published in . At this time, my meeting with Sensei Yamagishi had a significant impact on my life as a writer, and my relationship with Sensei lasted for about 28 years until just before his death. I organized quite a few exhibitions at the Maki Gallery, including several solo exhibitions and group exhibitions I planned, including ‘Korean Contemporary Group 6 Artists’ Dong-Sutra Exhibition’, ‘Structure and De-Structure Exhibition’, and ‘9 Korean Artists Exhibition’. In addition, an exhibition planned by Mr. Yamagishi called ‘The Three Artists of Korean Contemporary Art’ was an exhibition in which Kim Jong-il, Moon Gon, and Kim Jae-gwan were invited. , 'Discipline and Sensitivity Two-person Invitational Exhibition' was a very meaningful special exhibition in which Nagasaki's representative contemporary artist Seiryo Igawa and I were invited. In particular, the 'Korea-Japan Contemporary Art New Generation Artist Exhibition', which was launched by Mr. Yamagishi and himself in 1991, was very dynamic, traveling to Japan's Seibu Museum of Art, Cheongju National Museum, Chiba Prefectural Museum of Art, and Cheongju Arts Center until 1995. The Korea-Japan Exchange Exhibition served as an important catalyst for promoting exchanges between young artists between Korea and Japan. The Japanese writers I interact with most closely now - Yutaka Yoshinaga, Hiroshi Takeuchi, Kazuyuki Uno, etc. - are all friends I have interacted with since that time. In addition, Professor Seiryo Igawa, who had a two-person exhibition at the Maki Gallery, was a professor at Nagasaki University, but is an artist with whom we have continued to interact until recently. There has been a long history of exchanges between Cheongju artists and Nagasaki artists, and the 'Stratas of Korean-Japanese Contemporary Art' exhibition that has been held since 2011 between Cheongju and Kyoto, which Professor Kazuyuki Uno and I have jointly planned, is also all done by Yamagishi. It can be said to be an exhibition that developed from a relationship with the world. In addition, the Steps Gallery, run by artist Masami Yoshioka for Yamagishi Sensei and the East, in Ginza 4-cho, is thought to be playing a role in opening up the later period of the Yamagishi era. In June 2012, I had an interview with two curators at the National Art Center in Tokyo about their relationship with Mr. Yamagishi, his subsequent activities in the Korea-Japan Exchange Exhibition, and his interest in Korean culture and art. Ma Jeong-yeon, a Korean intern educator, participated in the interview. The contents were kept as materials for the National Art Museum. Before that, in 2009, the year after Mr. Yamagishi passed away, a memorial article was published in the 165th issue of the Japanese monthly art criticism Aida (published on October 20, 2009), “My true teacher, Mr. Yamagishi!” (わが眞)の恩師, 山岸信郞) has been published. In addition, the book “Notes from Tamura Gallery” published in 2013 (田村畵廊ノノ―ト, 山岸信郞著, 竹內博發行) includes ‘Sendai-Daegu Contemporary Art Exchange Exhibition’, ‘Chiba-Cheongju- The teacher's efforts to promote exchanges between Korea and Japan's contemporary art, such as planning activities for the 'Qingzhou Contemporary Art Exchange Exhibition' and participating as a lecturer for the 'Southern Korea Contemporary Art Exhibition', are specifically included. The teacher came to Korea in the spring of 2006, two years before his death, and lived in my hometown, Cheongju, for about three months. After organizing all the art galleries in Tokyo, he came to Korea to rest and study Korean. After consulting with me, he applied for a Korean conversation course at Cheongju University Lifelong Education Center and put in a lot of effort to learn Korean. In fact, the teacher had planned to stay with me in Cheongju for a while longer, but after receiving word that his wife in Tokyo was in critical condition, he quickly returned to Japan that summer. He took care of his wife for a year, but she died. Less than a year later, the teacher also passed away. In the subtitle of his book “Tanmura Art No-T”, “A Fool’s Life (あるアホの一生),” the teacher said, “Beliefs, dogmas, and society are not the perception of a community. “For all artists, art is not absolute but a relative phenomenon.” In the end, art is not just the artist's dogma but also the echo of social phenomena. It seems to be saying. I attended the second anniversary of Mr. Yamagishi's memorial service held at Ginza 2nd Street in August 2010. The elder masters who are currently driving the Japanese art world gathered at the event venue, which appeared to be about 100 pyeong (approximately 100 pyeong). I recited a eulogy on behalf of a Korean writer, but I did not feel at ease. And the next day, I visited Mr. Yamagishi's original home in Yamagada City with writer Masami Yoshioka and visited his gravesite right next door. Four years after my visit to Cheongju, Korea, my teacher and I had no choice but to meet in front of the tombstone. Although the 30-year relationship between my teacher and I ended like this, I began to think that there were still many unfinished things that remained. In Japan, writer Hiroshi Takeuchi, who had been by the teacher's side all his life, compiled the teacher's manuscripts that he had always written and published them as “Tamura Gallery Notes.” Isn't having this exhibition something I can do, or rather must do, as I have had more love and interaction with you than any other Korean artist? think. I wonder what the teacher would think if he found out that I founded and run an art museum. Seven years have already passed since your death, but your noble aesthetic spirit and dream of modern art exchange between Korea and Japan continue to be continued and developed by us. Therefore, I believe that this Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, 『On the present of Korean and Japanese contemporary art』, 『Tan-村·朞木時代以後、Korean-Japanese Contemporary Art in the 90s』 will be recorded as the most beautiful exhibition in the history of Korean-Japanese contemporary art.",

                explanation: "The problem in the inland area is that although there is a school zone, there is no shoulder where children and residents can walk safely. Children's protection zones are areas where vehicle speeds are proposed to be limited to 30 km/h to prevent traffic accidents involving children. However, although this road has been created as a school zone within 300m of the elementary school, there is no safe shoulder, so there is a problem that children and residents who are pedestrians have to ‘watch their surroundings’. In order to take that approach, this ‘Good Road Project’ seeks to approach the village with a ‘pictogram’ as a means of communication designed to be easily understood by anyone. Using communication tools designed to be easily understood by anyone, we aim to create a symbol that symbolizes the promise of the public sector and local residents by promoting the ‘Culture Love Room’ and carrying out a project to create streets where children can walk safely. Going beyond simple design, we aim to create results that standardize public responsibilities required in everyday life, revitalize local communities, and provide solutions to everyday problems. In addition, the ‘Memory Path Finding Program’ seeks to find village paths that disappeared for the elderly as villages expanded and the habit of walking changed to a convenient means of transportation such as cars. Finding the lost old roads of a developing village is intended to help local residents find nostalgia for the lost roads and revitalize the area, and can become the basis for forming another culture in the village.",

This exhibition was planned with the hope that our children will be immersed in the unique characters of seven active artists these days and the space where the characters live. By looking at the characters, I wanted to talk more with my family and re-express the characters in the authors' works in my own way. The character has characteristics that can be shared with the public due to its friendly image and ease of delivery. We exhibit two-dimensional, three-dimensional and animation works created with the theme of characters that are likely to appear in comics. The exhibition “Which ‘Star’ Are You From?” does not stop at just replicating cartoons, but reinterprets the subject matter in a creative way and is accessible to children, families, and visitors in a more direct way. On the other hand, it will be a beautiful exhibition that provides splendid visual enjoyment and stimulates the imagination of growing children.",

                explanation: "A new center of art + ing The biggest change in North Chungcheong Province in 2014 will be the integration of Cheongwon and Cheongju. I believe that this change is directly related to the issue of how to inherit and develop Cheongju City's culture and arts. In this sense, within this special integrated special exhibition in Cheongju, “Dream of the New Cheongju,” the Shema Art Museum invited and exhibited two-dimensional and three-dimensional works by 22 contemporary artists under the subtheme of “New Center of Art.” The writers are based in Cheongju, show a modern perspective, have strong personalities, and have a clear voice. They are also the people who lead Cheongju's culture and arts. The artists at the ‘Center of New Art’ at the Schema Museum of Art can be broadly divided into three groups. Among them, we cannot leave out the veteran artists Byeong-gak Min, Bu-nam Jang, Jae-gwan Kim, Ki-hong Eom, and Dong-young Kim, who have always reliably protected the contemporary art of Cheongwon and Cheongju. Each of them is unique and has their own originality, and they are still actively working on works that go beyond regional boundaries with the idea that Cheongju is the world and the world is Cheongju. The world of his work continues to evolve without stopping, putting the term “senior and mid-career artist to shame”. They are supported by senior writers such as Lee Don-hee, Jeong Chang-hoon, Son Bu-nam, Lee Gyu-sik, Choi Cheol, Lim Eun-su, and Son Soon-ok, and serve as a link between senior writers and young writers. In the art world of Cheongwon and Cheongju, there are strong, mid-career artists who have been steadily pursuing their creative work for more than 20 years. Mid-career artists use materials that demonstrate the extreme diversity of modern art, ordinary but easily overlooked topics, pure abstraction, paintings with rich textures, and elements that allow them to communicate with the audience while freely using three-dimensional, photography, performance, and installation. I am currently working on my work. Representative young artists within the boundaries of contemporary art in our region include Kim Gyeong-seop, Shin Cheol-woo, Lee Kyung-hwa, Eum Yeon-kyung, Lim Mina, Choi Min-geon, Han Seong-su, and Ko Gyeong-nam, who graduated from art schools in the Cheongju area or are active artists with ties to the region. These are works that reveal social issues or show the microscopic senses of individuals with unique perspectives and novel personalities, such as problems hidden behind the spectacular society, issues that exist in daily life but have not been noticed, personal narratives using storytelling techniques, etc. It shows multi-layered issues. In addition, we look at the world with youthful passion and intense concern and never stop challenging and attempting new art. It is said that the genres and boundaries of art are infinite. We hope that the infinite thoughts and works of artists about this will empathize with the art of Cheongwon and Cheongju, as works that evoke imagination and thought that do not stop in the present and future rather than in the past. We also send a round of applause and hope to the artists in Cheongwon and Cheongju who have never stopped challenging and attempting new art with their indomitable will.",

                explanation: "“Conversational Climate 2014” Korea-Japan New Generation Exhibition The history of exhibition exchange between artists from Cheongju, Korea and Nagasaki, Japan, who are active in contemporary art, has already been over 10 years. The beginning came from a two-person exhibition held at the Tokyo Jinwood Gallery between the author, who was a professor at the College of Art at Cheongju University at the time, and Professor Seiryo Ikawa, a professor at the Department of Art Education at Nagasaki National University. Afterwards, Professor Ikawa invited five young artists representing the Cheongju area to participate in the “[ima] From Nagasaki” exhibition held at the Nagasaki Brick Hall Gallery. The exchange exhibition that had been held for 10 years with artists from Chiba Prefecture until 2,000 years ago was converted into an exhibition between Cheongju and Nagasaki. Of course, there have been several exchange exhibitions between Nagasaki artists and Cheongju artists, but this is the first exhibition in which Nagasaki’s ‘Ring Art’ group and Cheongju’s ‘Aspect’ group participate simultaneously. Therefore, I believe that exchanges between young artists will become more active through this exhibition. Since Korea and Japan are closest neighbors, they have many cultural similarities. It is also true that historically, conflict and conflict have occurred the most. And conflict still persists due to differences in interpretation and perception of imperial Japan's invasion and domination. Even after 60 years, the aftereffects of Japan's militaristic invasion and domination continue to be the biggest obstacle to friendship between the two countries. Considering that Japan is also a country that is still healing the great wounds of being a defeated country after the war, peace is our hope and the hope of humanity. The name of the ‘Ring Art’ group in Nagasaki is said to be derived from the ‘ring’ of a jellyfish. It is said that Mr. Shinomura (下村 脩), a graduate of Nagasaki University, won the Nobel Prize in Science for his ‘research on green protein in jellyfish’ and was awarded the first honorary doctorate by Nagasaki University. The image of Professor Ikawa's work, who happened to be drawing ring-shaped works at the time, coincided with the 'ring' shape of a jellyfish, and in that image, the 'ring' of a person, the 'harmony' of peace, and the 'ring' of the environment. )”, it is said that it symbolizes the meaning of eternal peace with two circles that contain the meaning of “circle (円)” or circle of perfection. In the latter part, 'Aspect' symbolizes the possibility of infinite change, and if interpreted as a phenomenological predicate, it refers to 'Ansicht', but all art is common to all aesthetic objects and has a unique evidentiary effect. Not only is this not true, but post-postmodern art contains the idea that it is even more so. This suggests that all complex and diverse modern artists will have the value of their time only when they exist with different ‘aspects’. The spirit of “Ring Art” is spreading new contemporary art from Nagasaki while praying for peace in Nagasaki, which was bombed by radiation. Additionally, ‘post-aspect’ values ​​creation, the eternal spirit of artists in the new era after modernism. I think the joint exhibition of the two groups at Cheongju Schema Museum of Art is very meaningful in many ways. Culture is a higher concept than politics and economics. In addition, art is the embodiment of true values ​​that go beyond the spirit of the times and predict a new future. We would like to thank Professor Seiryo Ikawa for specially exhibiting our work at the “Conversational Climate 2014” Korea-Japan New Generation Exhibition with young writers from Nagasaki. We would like to congratulate and thank all the young artists from Korea and Japan who submitted their works. thank you",

                explanation: "A work of art is the most complete result of self-expression than anything else in the world. Therefore, writers living today need the ability to read the present and sense the direction of change. However, in these ever-changing times, it has become very difficult to predict and detect changes in the world using human capabilities. Now, writers live in an era that requires an eye to accurately read the present and a sensitivity to express it based on humanistic imagination. Last year, the 'Aspect Contemporary Art Association', which had been developing art movements from a modern perspective and devoted itself to establishing local contemporary art, celebrated its 25th year of history, and to commemorate this, it held a rapidly changing perspective of the past 25 years. In order to seek the direction of tomorrow, we will hold 'Speaking Through Art' by artists who have been working in Cheongju for some time (Daecheongho Art Museum, November 5-30, 2013) and 'Look at the Future' by new artists who will show the perspective of Cheongju art in the future. There was an exhibition called '(Schemar Art Museum 2013. 10. 24-11. 15). After finishing last year's exhibition and thinking about the next 25 years, I thought that it would be nice to create an art environment where we can feel more change and movement. This year's exhibition in 2014 is titled 'Super Match - Meet another me.' The steering and executive committee members each select and invite their favorite artists - preferably unfamiliar from the local perspective - to pair with them. We have prepared an exhibition to achieve this. In this exhibition, we aim to communicate by comparing the characteristics of each artist and that of other artists he or she is paired with. This is an expression of the desire to inject new air and communicate even for a moment within the boundaries of the region, and through this exhibition, the artists selected because they are liked by the artist are from another artist's perspective, so the artists on both sides can be understood by comparing them. I hope it will be of great help in looking into it. I hope that it will be an opportunity to look at the pluralistic art of the present era through the perspectives of artists interacting with each other, through art from various perspectives and through communication between artists. Humans think they know themselves best. However, we know very well how inadequate and foolish it is, so we try to find ourselves through various methods. What you see on the outside can be confirmed with your own eyes, but looking inside yourself is very difficult to confirm because you cannot see it directly. Who am I? We often check our appearance in the mirror. But I know that I can't see everything about myself. Therefore, I wonder if artists also continue to visualize themselves by endlessly asking questions. There are many cases where we indirectly infer our own appearance by looking at the things around us that we feel with our five senses, the people we meet, and the writers and works we like. I think that one of the wiser ways is to read myself through other objects rather than looking at myself. Because if you know how to see yourself correctly, that is the way to see things correctly. For this exhibition, I recommended one artist, and the work will be hung in the same space. Through this exhibition, I will meet a different version of myself. There are many ways to know yourself, but one of them is through other people. I believe that in a social atmosphere where something is being pursued, meeting another artist and talking with them will be an opportunity for the artists to take a break and look into themselves, and for the appreciators, it will be an opportunity to meet and compare the works of another artist selected by the artist. . Who did other writers invite? What perspective do they have? I'm very excited to meet other artists I don't know, and I look forward to the exhibition where I can talk to them.",

The four artists participating in the contemporary art exhibition are active artists at home and abroad. Kim Young-ja's work explores the nature of creation and extinction of natural beings and phenomena... The process is symbolized as a one-time rite of passage from human birth to death and a festival of seeds and holidays that are repeated in cyclical time. The division and overlap of the color field is a structure that establishes the simultaneity of living space and creation and extinction, and the square is a natural space, and the characteristic of time is that it penetrates inside and outside from the depths of the color screen. Artist Kim Hye-sook's work is the 'Soot Series', which depicts the inner unconscious world in black paint and is expressed endlessly on the canvas, creating a black hole-like image that mysteriously draws the viewer into it. Author Jang Hyeon-kyung’s ‘Into Memories…’ ’ The work starts from a house in one’s hometown, moves from the shape of the house to the village, and shows the image of a simple house on overlapping paint. In addition, it is interesting to see how the longing for home in childhood is expressed in colors that allow one to read the warm love of a family. Howl's works do not stay forever. Like a grasshopper that doesn't know where to jump, the artist's inner world jumps up and expresses a new world. Also, in this ‘Holiday’ work, you can meet Howl on another holiday day.",

                explanation: "“Good handwriting and touching writing” Woochon (雨邨) Shin Cheol-woo (辛哲宇) is a promising young calligrapher who graduated from the first class of the calligraphy department at Keimyung University College of Fine Arts. From his school days, he had a bright personality that made many people feel comfortable with his positive outlook on life and optimistic sensibility. Even when learning calligraphy, I was not stressed and had fun while learning calligraphy. The image of Uchon clearly comes to mind at that time when he was writing in an interesting way, clearly expressing his own interpretation without being bound by format. After graduation, while teaching students in his hometown of Cheongju, Uchon entered graduate school and completed his master's degree with a thesis on character studies. He returned after broadening his perspective and perspective through a short study abroad in China. Uchon, who has studied steadily and devoted himself to work tirelessly, is now participating in a solo exhibition with dozens of works full of individuality. From the person who came to ask for the introduction, I heard about the growth story that I vaguely knew. This is because the human growth period becomes the background for the author's emotional thinking, artistic sensibility, and the formation of aesthetic consciousness. “My hometown was a mountainous valley with only mountains, sky, and the moon visible at night. When I was in elementary school, the presidential villa, Cheongnamdae, was built on Daecheong Dam, roads were paved and buses were introduced. Before that, carts were the only means of transportation and shamanism replaced medical facilities. The background of the poem ‘Going to Munui Village’, written by poet Go Eun after visiting the funeral of poet Shin Dong-moon’s mother, is my hometown, Sandeok-ri, Munui-myeon, and poet Shin Dong-moon is my uncle from the mountain village of Shin’s hometown. Nostalgia for my childhood hometown still lingers deep in my heart. I think I was able to do this kind of work because it is unsophisticated but still retains the natural warmth of life. Rather than images that are neatly organized or manipulated in a schematic manner, I try to pursue things such as the naive expressions of mountain villages that can be both unpleasant and comical, the comfort of various objects being placed in their respective places in harmony with nature, and beauty in my work. I did.' The overall feeling shown in the work is exactly as he said. It has the impression of relics that can easily be seen in museum cultural assets, and contains the purity of human life and essence. The roughness of Buncheong porcelain and the aesthetic sense of parodying the fish engraved on it into new life by calling it into the work are the attractive points of the work. The vessel that holds something is the origin of civilization that has existed since the Neolithic Age. Uchon's artistic potential, which exquisitely combines the primitiveness of vessels with such primitive images and calligraphy, a written art with thousands of years of history, may be a new work method that can shock and change the aesthetic consciousness of the older generation. This exhibition, which deeply considered the methodological issues of the work, recognizes the artist's capabilities in that it shows sufficient quality and level to receive funds supported by the Chungbuk Cultural Foundation. The greatest harvest from this work is that it was conceived as a dense network of thoughts, stored, and reproduced with a natural aesthetic that does not reveal any intentionality. Through complex multi-layered work of writing, carving, drawing, and painting, the artist's artistic labor doubled the depth and volume. Moreover, the artist's appearance is delicious, as he reconstructed the traditional character images of Jeonseo and Yeeseo into soft and unique forms and replaced them with calligraphic and pictorial images. There are two types of writing: well-written and moving. Uchon's calligraphy is a moving handwriting filled with the aesthetics of Dongchi (童痴), and is an element that will draw more attention to his work in the future.",

                explanation: "At the 1st Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition, “Sympathy and Difference in New Asia,” three of the birthplaces of the world’s four great civilizations are in the Asian region. The Mesopotamian Civilization, Indus Civilization, and Yellow River Civilization are the world's oldest civilizations, spanning from the Oriental region to Northeast Asia. However, after the Renaissance, it was Europe that led world civilization with the development of Western industry and science. It is an undeniable fact that the rapid development of Western civilization has led to the development of material civilization and living science, which has greatly contributed to improving the quality of life. However, as excessive competition between countries degenerated into wars of aggression, most Asian countries became targets of invasion by advanced European countries. Of course, Japan, which was the first among Asian countries to adopt Western civilization, increased its influence by invading and colonizing Asian countries along with Britain and France. All Asian countries that were directly invaded by European countries or by Japanese imperialism could not help but be greatly influenced by Western civilization. Asia's population is more than half of the world's population, and the birthplace of most ancient civilizations was in Asia, so the identity of Asian countries could not help but be greatly damaged. Since the mid-20th century, most Asian countries have been liberated from imperialist rule and Western civilization has faced another crisis. Among Asian countries, most countries, including Korea, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, have been concerned about their cultural identity. It becomes impossible not to do it. However, it is good to advocate for 'One Asia' while pursuing a new Asia, but that does not mean that China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, all of which have unique and unique cultures, cannot be treated as the logic of contemporary universal culture. It won't work. Broadly speaking, Asia and Europe are different, and each country in Asia has its own cultural style created through a specific era and history, so the 'Bed of Procrustes', which seeks to unify all peoples, history, and culture on Earth, is one. Western rationality should not be tolerated or imitated. The “Sympathy and Difference in New Asia” exhibition was held in 2008 after the founding exhibition of the ‘East Asia Contemporary Artists Association’, and has been held at Cheongju Shema Art Museum and Beijing’s Four Square Space Gallery since 2010, advocating ‘new center and future’. There were exchange exhibitions such as ‘遇’, ‘和而不同’, and ‘必然中的偶然’. Of course, exchange exhibitions 'Horizon of Current Art in Japan' and 'Meaning of Communication' were held between Korea and Japan at 'Saga Art Center' and 'Shema Art Museum' in Kyoto, and with Nagasaki, there was a 'climate of dialogue' through exchange exhibitions between local groups. The 2014 Korea-Japan War was held. This series of events all put into practice the spirit pursued by the East Asia Contemporary Artists Association, that Asia is the ‘new center and future’ of the world, through contemporary art. While Western thought sought to dominate nature with human wisdom, Eastern spirituality generally sought to understand nature and humans as coexisting. Rather, they thought of themselves as insignificant beings in front of nature. Although there may be differences in degree, Eastern thought recognized humans as just one of many life forms in nature. In this way, the values ​​of Eastern and Western cultures are fundamentally very different. However, after postmodern art, we can see that the perception of nature and humans is changing in many ways. In particular, art emphasizes communication between humans and nature and refuses to remain within the traditional genre of plastic art. This phenomenon can be seen as art breaking away from modernism and opening up to a new pluralistic artistic direction since the 1970s. Since then, most artists' works have revealed a new awareness of the value of everyday life, as well as resistance and opposition to stereotypes or oppressed social systems. Art was not simply an image of an object, but also attempted to convey messages about healing, freedom, and social conflict. In the 21st century after postmodernism, we can see the integration and convergence of not only media, but also academic genres such as humanities and life sciences, and social structures and functions. Looking at this phenomenon, we say that digitalization has been completed, and that we have now entered the ‘post-digital’ era. In this way, art progresses from Da Vinci's paintings based on perspective to Cézanne's semi-perspective paintings and Picasso's Cubism to Duchamp's semi-pictorial object art and Nam June Paik's video art. Traces of art that were written and drawn as ‘history’ until the 20th century are now being recorded as anti-art images or videos, just as Nam June Paik declared the end of history. Therefore, the art of today is not the linear minimal art pursued in the past modernism, but is created and synthesized according to the artist's thoughts and various purposes, and as can be seen in the digital world, history is a narrative and event. , we are heading towards a very unclear world, mixing facts with fiction and reality with virtuality. It is said that Asian art started from the idea of ​​respecting ‘history’. That is why Asia is said to be the origin of a historical era centered on text. If the origin of Western art was realistic and the ultimate goal was to reproduce what already exists, Eastern art can be said to be a presentation of what does not exist because it realizes the world of speculative ideas. The world of ideas is no different from the digital world that creates fictional and virtual worlds. If philosophy begins with distinguishing between the virtual and the real, art can be said to be an aesthetic action between the virtual and the real that presents philosophical thinking as a visual object, whether it is an image or a concept. The 1st Cheongju International Contemporary Art Exhibition in 2014 is an international exhibition in which over 50 artists from 7 Asian countries participate. Cheongju City, a city of culture and arts with 1,400 years of history, was reintegrated on July 1 of this year 66 years after it was separated in 1948 due to Cheongju Cheongwon, and was launched as Unified Cheongju City. The newly launched Cheongju is a city of education, culture and arts as well as life science and high-tech industries, and is the heart of Korea's transportation with an international airport and KTX junction station. This event began by celebrating and commemorating the newly launched Cheongju, and the theme was ‘New Asia · Sympathy and Difference’. Through this exhibition, which begins in the first year of integrated Cheongju, what is the ‘Oriental spirit’ in modern art? I believe that our culture and arts will be a very useful time to discuss how there is ‘sympathy’ and ‘difference’ within one Asia. How are cultural similarities and identities within Asia progressing in contemporary art? I believe this will be a good opportunity to take a look at this exhibition ‘New Asia: Sympathy and Difference’.",

                explanation: "2014 Regional Specialized Culture and Arts Education Support Project Results Report Exhibition: Talking Through Art, Looking into the Heart In the age of aging, which is a recent social issue, this project aims to provide an art experience for intergenerational communication with the silver generation and children in the Cheongju Naesu region. This is a 'together art experience' project that provides easy-to-understand art experiences to children at local children's centers and the elderly at Chojeong Yaksu Nursing Home, and to foster emotional communication between generations, fostering the pathos ideology that has been missing a lot in recent years. We develop and operate an art experience program as a way to network among the underprivileged in the region, and through this, we provide a ‘place of communication and harmony’ where generations can talk through art. This project, which will be carried out for three years with the goal of discovering local culture and arts education resources and establishing connectivity (networking) between major organizations in the domestic region, has been carried out under the theme of 'Harmony (和合) - Become one through artistic language', continuing from last year. , the works and results made by children and the elderly throughout 2014 will be displayed, allowing you to take a look at the meaningful steps taken over the past year. 2014 Dream Attic Saturday Cultural School ‘Upside Down Art Museum’ Results Report Exhibition: Art Forest with Local Artists ‘Kum Attic Saturday Cultural School’ is an out-of-school Saturday culture and arts education hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and organized by culture and arts institutions and organizations. It's a program. In celebration of the 5-day school week system, this is a culture and arts education program that creates a leisure culture where children and adolescents can cultivate cultural and artistic knowledge and communicate with peers and family every Saturday. “Upside Down Museum,” hosted by the Korea Association of Private Art Museums, is a program tailored to museums that incorporates the “flipped classroom” education method, which started in the American education field in 2010 and has recently spread around the world. Just as the 'flipped classroom' education method adds fun and depth to study through various activities instead of boring lecture-style classes that were originally done in classrooms, the upside-down museum reverses the existing exhibition-related education format and replaces the stereotype of 'studying' works of art. It consists of the VTS (Visual Thinking Strategy) interactive program, where families, children, and teenagers have 'free' conversations with 'no right answer' in front of works of art, and various experiential activities (visiting artist studios/creative art experience education, etc.) 25 registered private organizations nationwide participating in the project using the VTS (Visual Thinking Strategy) teaching method, which involves asking and answering open questions and answers about a topic or situation without providing information about the work in front of a work of art. This is a program that allows you to appreciate works of art at museums and artist studios affiliated with the museum in the region. Rather than a traditional one-time, simple experiential art experience, the program visits the museum every Saturday for at least a month, allowing families, children, and teenagers from all over the country to interact with artists. This is an educational program that helps students recognize art museums as a part of their lives and artistic playgrounds through encountering works of art and experiencing various things inside and outside the museum. Shema Art Museum's 'Forest of Art with Local Artists' was a total of 6 programs with artists Lee Yu-na, Ohelian, Park Jin-myeong, Park Young-hak, Kim Seung-hoe, and Han Seong-su. is exhibiting photos of field sketches, activity sheets, and result reports from activities with artists over the past year. 2014 Shema Children’s Art School ‘2nd’ DOCUMENT Exhibition: Shema Children’s Art School “Me too, Picasso!” The Shema Art Museum, which represents modern art in the Cheongju area, not only holds special exhibitions of contemporary art, but also uses the various strengths of the art museum for the creative education of children and operates the 'Shema Children's Art School' for infants, toddlers, elementary school students, daycare centers, and elementary schools. is operating. The educational method of the Children's Art School at the Schema Museum of Art is project-type experiential education, with exhibition programs linked to unique ideas and educational programs tailored to the level of children. In addition, in order to provide children with a variety of experiential education beneficial to their creativity and imagination, we provide easy and fun education on modern art so that they can grow into talented children with outstanding imagination. Shema Children's Art School, which started its second session this year, has been conducting project classes in various genres, including exhibition-related programs, May Family Month special exhibitions and special programs, performance programs, and artist-linked programs, with about 50 children over the past year. In this exhibition, you can take a look at interesting works created by children's free imagination and dreams.",

                explanation: "‘Hyeonsan Fish’ is Korea’s first marine biology book written about 200 years ago and contains information on the characteristics, habits, and uses of hundreds of species of marine life. This book is attracting attention in various fields because of its historical significance and value as a resource. However, the fact that the translation of ‘Hyeonsaneobo’ was published by a Japanese person named Shibuzawa, not a Korean, shows that awareness of the importance of our historical heritage is serious. Although it is a biology book about fish, the various records it contains are essential spiritual heritage for us. We have recently shown interest in native culture and are trying to maintain and develop its value. Although we have already protected and recorded many heritage sites, there are still some shortcomings in the scope of the field of study and the modernity and diversity of conservation. This project, which pays attention to these points, is a plan to expand and reproduce the spirit of 'Hyeonsan Geobo' through modern visual art and by examining natural history and taxonomy that can be implemented as art, and to expand and reproduce the meaning of the past that led to the growth of the city centered on Musincheon. Looking at the shape of Cheongju City, it was assumed that the growth of the integrated Cheongju City would be centered around Mihocheon, and it began by reexamining the relationship between Mihocheon and Cheongju through the value of our indigenous culture. – Project Team YellowOcher (Seunghoe Kim, Inhee Lee, Wanyoung Do, Yuyu Seo) ‘YellowOcher’, a project group that creates works that avoid intervening in the communication and publicness of individuals and society, is a project group that creates works that avoid intervening in the communication between individuals and society, and the public nature of nature and cities, tradition and modernity. I aim for work that reveals time that has disappeared or been cut off. We explore memories and identity of traditional culture through the language of modern visual art, and develop new experiments in public art. In this project, we traced the disconnected or disappeared times of Mihocheon through Mihocheon and surrounding villages, and collected and investigated tangible and intangible cultural resources. By recording photos and videos, we worked to reveal the relatively neglected indigenous culture of Cheongju. – Project team ‘Sam’ (Jin-myeong Park, Young-hak Park, Cheol-woo Shin, Min-geon Choi, Soon-wook Kwon) Sam, and another story encountered in Mihocheon: Traces – Focusing on collecting, Sam (Deep Water of Sam) has been collecting soil and fortress near Cheongju. As I went around, I transferred the traces and small collections to canvas or displayed them as public art. In other words, the past and present coexist with us, but we find small traces that we are not aware of and provide interesting imagination to show another world of reality. The motivation for participating in this Mihocheon project is that I visited Jeongbuktoseong, Bubusanseong, and Sangdangsanseong, and their history is closely related to Mihocheon. Through our field trip to Mihocheon, we discovered various relics and relics from prehistoric times in a waterway called Mihocheon, and through traces of ancient people, Cheongju and Cheongwon have shared history and culture since ancient times by sharing Mihocheon. In this project, rather than researching the history of Mihocheon, I would like to look for the missing traces from the perspective of an art major. In particular, I try to express emotional products about past absences, such as past memories, longing, and regret, through drawing and collecting based on ruins and relics, things that have disappeared due to changes in ecology (fish species), and village treasures.",

                explanation: "mycheongjuchandelierchohab is a work that appears to be composed of a series of chandeliers and is the work of Dirk Fleischmann, who is currently living and working in Cheongju. For this work, the artist formed a kind of production and distribution association consisting of himself, Park Seon-ah, Park Jeong-seon, Park Seon-ju, Shin Hyo-cheol, Kim Seo-yeon, Jang Min-hee, Jin Hee-woong, and Yoon Hong-san, and through this combination, various types of chandeliers were formed and produced. Sell, display, and distribute. When you encounter this work as a viewer or consumer, you encounter the actual chandelier or see a photographed image of the chandelier (as in this catalog), and you naturally identify the artist's work with the chandelier. However, to be precise, neither the actual physically existing chandelier nor the images taken of it are the works of Dirk Fleisch alone. His work is the form and concept itself of a combination that simulates – or actually carries out – the economic structure of chandelier production, production, and distribution. In short, the process and framework of creating products that can generally be considered ‘work’ exist as the work of artist Dirk Fleischmann. This type of work, which is a mixture of artistic work, capitalist commercial activity, and product production and distribution, and is difficult to frame as an individual work of art in general, was created when the artist was a student at the Städelschule and set up a kiosk on campus to distribute small products. It is a continuation of the early works, mykiosk (1998-2002), myvendingmachine (1999-2000), which expanded the business by acquiring a vending machine on campus, Missing Money (2004), which consists of works using products with an imminent expiration date, and the virtual world. Real Estate (2007), which sold real estate on a built-in web service, myforestfarm (2008~), which purchased land in the rainforest to grow plants and established its own carbon emissions credit system, and Made in North Korea, which produced clothing at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea. (2010), the scope and form were gradually expanded. What is noteworthy here is that, for Dirk Fleischmann, the profits generated from a series of quasi-capitalist activities carried out in the form of work were continuously used and expanded for the next work. In other words, mycheongjuchandelierchohab is a temporary stopover point that the author arrived at, expanding in size, scope, and form through a series of systems built by the capital he created while selling chocolate bars and candies at his alma mater in Frankfurt, Germany, and the resulting Profits will also be used as capital for the artist's next work. Regarding capitalism, which seems to completely dominate the world today, the author takes the view that there is no “outside” to it. The “outside” that is loudly proclaimed in many resistant discourses and critical theories may be nothing more than an illusion. Dierk Fleischmann's work, which is reminiscent of a business that is constantly expanding in form and scale, is an act that can be considered capitalist rather than imagining the “outside” of capitalism in order to promote a critical/critical perspective. By directly carrying out the work, I myself embody the structure and aspects of capitalism, and from that very point create a gap for critique/critique.",

                explanation: "The history of Cheongju artists' exchange exhibitions with Japanese artists begins with the 'New Generation Exhibition of Japanese-Korean Contemporary Art' (Chiba Prefectural Museum of Art) co-curated by art critic Yamagishi Sensei (representative of Tokyo's Maki and Tamura Gallery) and the author in 1991. My relationship with Yamagishi began when I held my first solo exhibition in Japan in 1981 at another gallery he ran (Komai Gallery). In the 80s and 90s, Japanese contemporary art was already at a significant global level, and in Korea, the contemporary art movement centered in Seoul was just beginning. Therefore, it was a time when artists from Cheongju, a provincial area, could not even dream of exhibiting in Tokyo. However, since the beginning of a deep relationship between Yamagishi Sensei and the author, Cheongju artists have held individual, group, and group exhibitions with artists in Tokyo and Chiba for nearly 10 years, and even after Yamagishi quit the gallery, Professor Searyo Igawa Due to the relationship with Nagasaki artists, it changed into an exchange exhibition. However, what can lead our relationship back to Kyoto and back to Tokyo is the young artists of the time, such as Hiroshi Takeuchi, Seiryo Igawa, Hiroshi Yoshioka, Seiryo Igawa, and Kazuyuki Uno, who have been active at the Maki Gallery since the 1980s. This is possible because their relationship continues to this day. Strictly speaking, the exhibition 『Stratum of Korean Contemporary Art in Japan』 held at Kyoto's “Art Space Saga Gallery” (within Saga University of Arts) last year was an extension of the 『New Generation Exhibition of Japanese and Korean Contemporary Art』 held in Chiba in 1991. can do. This is because Kazuyuki Uno, who participated as a young artist at the time, served as a head professor at Saga University of Arts in Kyoto, rekindling my long-standing relationship with him. In particular, last year's exhibition in Kyoto was a very difficult time because it followed the disaster of a large tsunami in northeastern Japan in March of that year. Nevertheless, our exhibition went ahead as promised. It was held wonderfully with the sincere support of the Dean of Saga University of Arts, professors, and students. And the works of Korean artists were exhibited again at the Schema Museum of Art in Korea, and this exhibition featured the works of four professors and artists from Kyoto Saga University of Arts (Kazuyuki Uno, Minako Irisha, Ichiro Hasegawa, and Yukiko Nagamichi). The exchange exhibition between Kyoto, the historical city of ancient Japan, and Cheongju, the 1,300-year-old capital of Korea, has special meaning from a historical perspective. This is because the culture of Baekje, an ancient Korean state, still remains in Kyoto, and Cheongju also has historical relics of Goryeo and Joseon from the Three Kingdoms period. Among them, the most representative heritage is the place where the 『直指』, which is the most ancient of modern-day literature in the world, was produced. It is enough to imagine what the cultural status of Kyoto and Cheongju would have been like during the ancient state era a thousand years ago. Celebrating the 4th anniversary of the opening of the Schema Art Museum in Cheongju, we are very pleased to hold the Kyoto + Cheongju exhibition, 『The Meaning of Communication』, a Korea-Japan contemporary art exchange exhibition in which major artists including professors, graduates, and graduate students of Kyoto Saga University of Arts participate. This exhibition features some of the artists who participated in the Kyoto exhibition 『Korea - Strata of Current Art in Japan』 two years ago, as well as new members, but all major artists representing our region are participating. I am very happy to meet again my old friend, Professor Kazuyuki Uno, and other Kyoto artists. Although there are still political conflicts between Korea and Japan, I believe that our meetings through active exchanges will continue to evolve and develop into greater friendship.",

                explanation: "The memory of artist Lee Se-jeong's work was one of power and clarity, with free strokes and dynamic energy. Even though we have been together for over 10 years, it seems like it took a lot of time to get to know the work seriously. The artist has been working steadily with interest in the use of free mental power called ‘Ilpumhwa’. The concentrated expression of such mental power must be adept at controlling energy from moment to moment, like the energy of creation and change in nature. This is because, sometimes violently like a storm, sometimes calmly like a clear sky, the planes and parts of the entire canvas are dismantled and reconstructed into a dynamic entity. The author may have tried to express the image of evil, both in his works with a literati painting style and in the world expressed with the force of single-stroke strokes. Is it possible to draw a heart? The author does not reveal the inner self and depicts it, but merely presents moments of oneness with oneself, where the exquisite spiritual power and paper, brush, and ink become one. Whether the support is cloth or paper, the brush of Oriental painting relies on momentary gestures, so it is impossible to do without considerable skill. One-of-a-kind freedom is achieved after being cultivated with such effort.",

                explanation: "The Schema Academy (Ecole de Schema), which was formed in January 2010 with the members' passion for continuous research on modern art, is now entering its fourth year. Meanwhile, various artists regardless of genre have gathered in one place to study difficult concepts of modern art, providing a foundation for each artist to develop their own work. Anarchism in modern art, where the boundaries between genres have collapsed after postmodernism, no longer allows for a single signifying system. Therefore, the work appears in different directions depending on the form in which it is expressed by the artists, and its interpretation is also developed in various ways. At this point, we need to ask ourselves what artists should truly pursue. Professor Jaegwan Kim says the following. ‘Ecole’ is a natural gathering of people in need. Studying for a new work is about organizing our thoughts and discovering knowledge that clears our complicated feelings. Yes. “Digging for knowledge that clears a complicated mind” – this would be no different from digging for gold in a gold mine. Just as gold ore must be mined and impurities removed to obtain pure gold, I think mining knowledge is the only alternative to modern art. In other words, I think that a work of art based on knowledge and accompanied by a logical explanation is a necessary condition for modern art. Shema Academy members titled this exhibition “Search & Seek.” “Search & Seek” literally means “search and seek.” The dictionary definition of search is ‘to grope to find out something that has been hidden, to grope to find out a hidden fact or phenomenon, etc.’ and the dictionary definition of search is ‘to think about and find a desirable solution that can solve a problem.’ It is ‘thinking here and there to find a method or solution.’ Here, I think that ‘to find by groping’ and ‘to find by thinking about this and that’ may be ‘digging for knowledge.’ As I have been studying with members, I have seen a series of moments of intellectual joy in which the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist Archimedes jumped out of the bathtub naked while shouting 'Eureka' from the expressions of the members. I could read it. ‘Eureka’ is a Greek word meaning ‘discovered’ or ‘figured out.’ It is a shout of joy when one discovers something. In Korean, it can be likened to ‘I tried it.’ The “Search & Seek” exhibition will be a good opportunity for each person to become Archimedes, shout ‘Eureka’, acquire theoretical knowledge, and naturally see the entirety of the various works incorporated into the work in one place. Of course, I would like to boldly say that the fact that all members were able to grow year after year was possible thanks to the hard work of Professor Kim Jae-kwan, who has devoted his entire life as a writer and educator to nurturing younger students. The professor once again taught difficult concepts of modern art in an easy-to-understand manner through the museum and guided us to put them into practice through various workshops and exhibitions. We would like to once again thank Professor Jaegwan Kim for his hard work and look forward to the infinite development of Shema Academy members in the future.",

                explanation: "2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale Network Exhibition Special Exhibition of Contemporary Art of the Same Generation - Invitation Message The 2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale will hold the long-awaited opening fanfare on September 11th at the site of the old Cheongju tobacco manufacturing plant under the theme of “Familiarity and Newness.” Although this is the eighth Biennale, it is the second to be held here following the 7th event in 2011. Chungcheongbuk-do has the second weakest provincial tax system after Jeju-do and is less competitive in all areas than other cities and provinces. However, for a long time, it was the first place in terms of tobacco production. It was also once the place with the highest tobacco production in Korea. After opening as the ‘Cheongju Tobacco Factory’ on November 1, 1946, the year after liberation, it was the cradle of modern industry representing Cheongju, with 2,000 workers until the Sintanjin Tobacco Factory was built in 1965. Afterwards, it was the largest cigarette factory in Korea, but due to new changes in industrialization, the manufacturing plant was completely shut down in 2004. The factory, which had been abandoned since then, is awaiting a new birth as the Cheongju International Craft Biennale was held in 2011 and new alternatives for utilizing the tobacco manufacturing plant were presented. Last year, at a symposium organized by Cheongju City, the author proposed using it as a ‘complex culture and arts space’ in a presentation titled “A new birth of the idle space of the former tobacco manufacturing plant.” This is because we thought that the only way to feel the history and future of Cheongju at the same time is to preserve the original form of the building and use it as a cultural and artistic space. It was suggested that the site with a total floor space of 16,530 pyeong could be used for the Biennale's permanent exhibition hall, storytelling museum, event hall, multi-purpose hall, residency, and foundation secretariat. In addition, it is a good thing that Cheongju City attracted the establishment of a branch of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (scheduled to open in 2015). It is expected that the synergy effect will be great as the permanent exhibition hall of the Craft Biennale and the branch of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art are located in one place. Following the ‘2011 Cheongju International Craft Biennale’, the fact that this event also held contemporary art exhibitions at several private art museums shows that the ‘2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale’ is not just an event limited to crafts. The “Generation Exhibition” refers to the generation that was born between liberation and before the Revolution and lived in college in the late 1960s, and is currently in the mid to late 1960s, and is the artist who is most active in creative activities among the group of leading artists in Korean contemporary art. points to them. The same generation group is evaluated as the first group to achieve both intellectual and qualitative growth, unlike the artists in their 80s, who are the first generation of Korean contemporary art and are the same age as our teachers, and the artists in their 70s, who belong to the 1.5 generation. Therefore, the same generation group can be said to be a true elite group equipped with ‘inner reason’ at a turning point in Korean contemporary art. The reason is that the 「Dong-generation exhibition」 group can be said to be the first generation after the turbulent period of Korean university education from the 1950s to the mid-1960s, the implementation of the university academic ability evaluation system, and the normalization of university education. Although there are many aspects that have been underestimated in the shadow of the teacher and predecessor generations, I believe that in the future, these generations will be given more importance as art historical evaluation follows. This exhibition, which is being held as a ‘network exhibition’ of the ‘2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale’ ahead of the launch of the integrated city of Cheongju and Cheongwon in 2014, is considered to be a very meaningful exhibition in light of several characteristics of the Cheongju region. Historically, Cheongju is the place where the first metal type book, “Jikjisimcheyojeol,” was published. It is also a city of education and culture and a city of cutting-edge life science and industry. In addition, Cheongju Osong Station is a junction station for the KTX high-speed train's Gyeongbu Line and Honam Line, and Cheongju International Airport is a key transportation hub for Korea's future, securing major domestic and international air routes. With the opening of the Cheongju Museum of Art in September 2014, Cheongju became the center of culture and arts in the central region with the formation of a cultural belt of the International Craft Biennale, the Cheongju Museum of Art, and the Cheongju Branch of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. The Cheongju International Craft Biennale has grown into a world-class biennale as it reaches its 8th edition. Interest in contemporary art will further spread, not just as a craft but also as a spiritual value that can predict future art in the 21st century. Therefore, it is a very good idea to hold the Craft Biennale and the contemporary art exhibition in parallel. I believe that the holding of the “Special Exhibition of Contemporary Art of the Same Generation” is a very important event that makes us think again about the value of painting as a pure art that is often neglected at the “Cheongju International Craft Biennale.” We wish the successful hosting of the 2013 Cheongju International Craft Biennale and would like to express our sincere congratulations and gratitude to all participating artists who submitted their works to this special exhibition.",

                explanation: "Postaspect (PACCA) - The changing present and current art in preparation for the exhibition commemorating the 25th anniversary of its founding. It seems impossible to predict the direction of change in the current world. At a time when all situations in the world are constantly changing, it has become more difficult to express this through an artist's perspective. It is a time when the eye to accurately read the present and the sense to express it are required. Aspect, which developed an art movement centered on artists based in Cheongju who showed modern perspectives and works, now has a history of 25 years. It was said that the rivers and mountains will change in 10 years, but now it shows that everything is changing rapidly every hour. This exhibition sought to bring together in one place the perspectives that Aspect has had over the past 25 years and the rapidly changing present, looking for the future direction of modern art. The exhibition is comprised of 'Speaking Through Art', an exhibition by artists who have been working in Cheongju for some time (Daecheongho Museum of Art, November 5-30, 2013), and 'Looking to the Future', an exhibition by new artists who will show the perspectives of Cheongju art in the future. Ready. Art is said to be ‘self-expression.’ Among them, art is about visualizing this. Each artist's work has the voice and tone of a contemporary writer. A work of art is something that artists living in the present have experienced and acquired and visualized with their own thoughts, so it contains a very important element called ‘present’. If in the past art was 'seeing art' to express one's thoughts, we are now in the era of 'reading art' where text exists in each work. Isn't it the artist who cultivates and evolves according to changes and the result is the work? Think about it. That may be why the term modern art itself is now being used as contemporary art, meaning the contemporary and present, rather than modern art. Gathering together artists who are expressing the present is not an easy task. Each writer's perception of the present is different, and since they are writers with particularly strong personalities and clear voices, their thoughts will also be different. I also think that it would be impossible to gather all these different perspectives of the present in one place, read each writer's thoughts, and try to find Cheongju's identity within them. For writers, the boundaries of region are already meaningless. This is because they work with the idea that Cheongju is the world and the world is Cheongju. Now that Cheongju and Cheongwon are integrated and are on the verge of becoming a megacity in the central region, I still hope that this will be read and placed in the 'Speaking Through Art' exhibition, and I am grateful to the artists who understood all of this and participated in the exhibition.",

                explanation: "Throwing into the evening silhouette. While visiting Kim Man-soo's workshop for over 30 years, we talked about various things from daytime to evening. By the time the sun breaks through the pine forest and passes over the sweet potato field, the three-dimensional space we know disappears and a two-dimensional silhouette comes into view. When the sunset had already disappeared and his heart was filling the emptiness of the lost space, he would say this. ‘Like homework, the sun leaves us with something to do and disappears.’ I heard these words as a hum, but he always kept them in his mind as homework and tried to express them in various ways. Since it is a task given by nature, it is a task given by the self to Taa. Would it have been so difficult for a pottery maker to find space on a flat surface? The intention to minimize the container's original meaning of containing space and to spatialize the vertical and horizontal contact points was rather unreasonable. By drawing a flat pine tree on a large plate or spraying unusual paints, I experienced for myself how difficult a simple ink line can be. This is how the work began and is still ongoing. In works commonly produced through dripping, the ego as the person drawing the picture is either a fluke work waiting for an effect called coincidence or a work that emphasizes the autonomy of the screen. The effect is subject to many variables depending on the situation, so it is difficult to easily achieve the desired image. Since there is inherent personification that recognizes objects as others as a kind of altruistic consideration, the ego is only an act of an artist, and in the image or philosophical background of the work, it is a part of the image or a void action that shows another version of myself (the other). You can see the work in . The ending of this work, which can be seen as a work of compulsion, was borrowed from the margin, a Korean image expression that creates a gap, forces an unexpressed space, and connects the gap to another person's perspective. In conclusion, his current work dreams of unifying the self through the work of excluding space and trying to unite self and other self within a plane. While altruistic practice, there is a deep will to abandon the foolishness of trying to distinguish between right and wrong within unrealistic images that exclude time and space and betray space and plane. It is easy to see that the nature of the material is very heterogeneous in terms of the intellectual aspect, but in the consciousness of a potter who has been making pottery for decades, there are many differences between earth and fire, and it is possible to see that fire and water are not different from each other in a kiln exceeding 1,000 degrees. A writer with romantic sensibility is capable of unrealistic perceptions because logic and ethics are absent or weakened and reason and values ​​are transcended, and he possesses the ability to understand disorder and disharmony. The beauty of the sublime is becoming his sensibility. The artistic emotions of a person who dreams of change have a passionate passion beyond that of a kiln, so I am curious and eagerly waiting to see what kind of humanistic meaning he will find in this work.",

                explanation: "Lim Eun-soo’s drawings that ‘engraved’ images and memories Contemporary artist Lim Eun-soo has several characteristics. Although he was born in Eumseong, a rural area in North Chungcheong Province, he attended middle school in Cheongju, graduated from college, and got married. Also, since he taught here, had children, and lived here, it would be appropriate to call him a Cheongju native. As a writer who has been senior here for nearly 20 years and who has observed him since his college years, I was able to discover several characteristics about him. Eunsu Lim is not my disciple because he has no connection with me as a priest. However, I have been exposed to his work since 2000 through the ‘Aspect’ association (founded by the author in 1988), a symbolic modern art group in Cheongju, and I was able to see his work at several special exhibitions at Musim Gallery. His passion for work, which always strives to create new and fresh works at each exhibition, led to his being selected as one of five young artists in Cheongju for a special exhibition invited to the 'Brick Hall', a culture and arts center in Nagasaki, Japan in 2004. He was selected and participated in the 「2004[ima] From Nagasaki」 exhibition, and his passion for art was confirmed. How can you display your work with maximum effect? He was very worried. And as he looked at Japan, his first overseas travel destination, his eyes were filled with curiosity, like Columbus discovering the new continent of America, as he felt that everything was new and amazing. He seemed to have a personality that was simple-minded, honest, and willing to accept everything positively. He had no desire to take everything and seemed uninterested in anything more than he needed. At that time, his work created images by embroidering translucent silk fabric, installed them, created objects that resembled the protoplasm of nature surrounding life, and also presented somewhat specific shapes. Some critics of her work at the time said, “Lim Eun-soo is an artist who adopts a form of feminism imbued with female sensuality and sense.” He commented: The works at the time used soft silk fabric and were largely about women's sensuality and senses, and I think they criticized Lim Eun-soo because her self-consciousness as a woman was clearly visible. After that, the characteristics I discovered in him were very ordinary, but not easy for other people to enjoy at the same time. I enjoy walking along Musimcheon Stream alone. I enjoy taking videos of the natural grass along Musimcheon Stream. In addition, it is customary to walk the 1.2km from the center of the city to the apartment and back home. Although he enjoys kalguksu and likes to be alone, he also has the characteristic of liking to hang out with people who have confidence in their faith. He enjoys sketching the surrounding landscape through photographs, and his skills are amazing. I've been able to see his photo sketches from time to time, and I can't help but admire his excellent angles. I would like to focus on ‘watching movies’ as the most important factor in forming Lim Eun-soo’s character. He is a huge movie buff. The average person might not watch even one movie a month, but he enjoys watching movies to the point where he watches three or four movies a day. Maybe he enjoys watching movies at the movies more than looking at paintings at art museums. It seems that movies are not simple for him. While a painting is a view of a scene of still images, a movie is a view of all moving images from the time the film starts rolling until it stops. So, a painting is a ‘description’ of an object, but a movie is an ‘inscription’ of movement. Also, the most important feature of the film is that it does not select any movement on the screen and accepts everything, including things that are unsightly, shaky, out of focus, suspicious, and accidentally taken without being hidden. The characteristic of Lim Eun-soo's personality can be found in the fact that, rather than drawing her immediate surroundings, she engraves things that pass by her like in a movie. As these cinematic features were absorbed into the stylistic characteristics of Lim Eun-soo's paintings, it seems that his paintings took on an anti-modernist character that refused to conform to the oppressive system. In the same context, it can be seen that the characteristics of the work emphasize the relationship with external elements rather than internal elements. While modernist painting reduced the unique self by focusing on exploring one's own unique form, we see that Eunsoo Lim is starting from a post-modernist awareness that always awakens the relationship with the external environment surrounding oneself. These characteristics are clearly evident in his ‘drawings’ and are going through several stages of change. So far, the propositions of his works include the 'Grow' series (c. 2006), which metaphorically expressed the conception and growth of life, the 'Wind Landscape' series (c. 2008), which attempted to express the waves of wind and air, and the vibration of objects. and the 'Deconstruction of Consciousness' series, which expresses the process of becoming unconscious through the dissolution of consciousness (c. 2010), and the installation work 'Light - The Deep Righteousness' series, which expresses the process of shedding the facade that hides the true nature (c. 2011). Kyeong), and his most recent work is the 'Passing' series (since 2012), which depicts his shaky psychological state as he dismantles his inner self and forms a larger self. Even in this flow, one can discover his consistent thoughts and expression methods. In his work, the lines, colors, light and shade, and volume found in modernist forms are all reduced and the screen is treated with simple colors. In particular, the work 'Passing', created since 2012, depicts the flow of one's emotions and psychological phenomena caused by physical phenomena such as time, wind, light, and sound, in a completely unconscious state, using simple colored physical 'lines' on the screen. I think it is expressed as '. Because drawing liberates ‘lines’ from the space of representation and illusion, it can be said to be an abstract act and conceptualization of painting that achieves the flatness of two-dimensional painting. In art history, drawing is divided into the case of ‘internal concept’ and the case of ‘external concept’ in the classic two concepts of Federico Zuccari, who established the concept of modern drawing. Here, the meaning of drawing was defined as the act of creating a shape through materials and a sign of an act that exists in an objective correspondence between ‘nature’, a creature created by God, and ‘humans’. Strictly speaking, ‘good’ is something that does not exist in nature and is understood as an intellectual object. Lim Eun-soo’s work ‘Passing’ can itself be seen as a ‘drawing’ of an ‘internal concept (disegno interno)’, and the ‘lines’ of her ‘drawing’ are the passage through which her emotions and play ‘pass’. In classical drawing, the 'lines' of Leonardo da Vinci's drawings were obsessed with the problem of representing the outline of objects through perception and understanding, while Lim Eun-soo's 'lines' represent the world as his sensibility, just as the 'lines' themselves are abstract. It can be said to be the ‘line’ of the world of ‘conceptual abstraction’. Just like the world of drawing, he also ‘places the world at the center of his mind’ and substitutes this into a two-dimensional plane through line drawing. He is ‘conceptualizing’ his drawing by using ‘lines’ as a means of formal expression without the help of any representational representation or illusion. As stated earlier, Lim Eun-soo's work is often interpreted as a 'feminist type' work due to the expressive technique of using flexible and soft materials. However, since the feminism talked about in postmodernism was originally started by revolutionary female artists, it was not about femininity, but had a political purpose of transcending ‘gender’ and eliminating gender discrimination. Compared to this historical truth, rather than asserting that Lim Eun-soo's work is feminist, I would rather say that it is 'Lim Eun-soo's painting', which has the non-deterministic and non-terminal characteristics contained in Derrida's meaning of difference. This is because his work is neither revolutionary nor gender-based, but rather cinematic and drawing-like. Eunsu Lim writes about his work as follows: “It is an interpretation of the sensuality of endlessly exploring the outside world with the tentacles of curiosity, and at the moment of shaking when the outside world knocks on the ego, trying to penetrate and match it, and barely maintains its balance, breaking itself apart to form a bigger self.” “Waves of air stirred by the wind, stirred by all kinds of sounds. Vibration that touches an object, objects reacting with brilliant waves of light, space fluctuates for various reasons, and objects react to this. My endless shaking that vibrates even with the slightest movement, exposing my fragile inner skin... Most of his recent works are drawings made with Korean pigments on ‘Korean paper.’ For installation works, vinyl and acrylic colors are used. Alternatively, you can make a thick rope by weaving thread with a crochet hook, or dismantle thick fur clothing and use it. Even in the case of installations, they are all consistent with his drawings. Most of his drawings are made up of repeated and overlapping lines, so they look like a technique performed in an unconscious state. His work, which is accomplished through emotional immersion, is a performance that moves through space rather than the movement of a brush drawing a screen, and can be said to be automatism. Just like a movie screen, his drawings appear to be an expression of the passage of time and continuous phenomena, and the movements of his lines within the screen seem to be a space where movement, rest, and continuously ongoing actions occur. The world that Lim Eun-soo thinks of is not a feminist idea, nor is it a simple sketch of nature, but the space of the screen that she encounters is, just as the canvas that Lee U-Hwan (李禹煥) first encountered was an infinite space of space, Lee Bul (Lee Bul) Just as this drawing landscape imagines the miserable state of the Earth that will appear hundreds of thousands of years from now, it is thought to be a supernatural world in which the artist unconsciously expresses the impulses, emotions, and symbols stored in his memory, allowing him to establish a dialogue with the outside world and himself. Lévi Strauss (French anthropologist) said, “The unconscious enables exchange with others and lays the foundation for symbolic thinking.” He said. Eunsoo Lim's immersion into the world of unconsciousness may rather be a repository of images and memories made up of various vocabularies of her world of imagination and world of representation. When looking at his work, at times you feel a sense of space like a vacuum of unconsciousness, and at other times you feel like you are in Henri Rousseau's lush jungle. Sometimes, I feel a superhuman divine energy from him. Lim Eun-soo, who has a unique atmosphere, condenses all of them into symbols of the conceptual language of modern art and pours them into her work. His passion for art is developing rapidly, crossing the boundaries between painting, installation, and performance. She is currently the president of the Cheongju Female Artists Association and will soon be turning 50. She will now be able to establish herself as a proud artist from our region, not only as a leader among female artists in our region, but also as an artist who shines in Korean contemporary art.",

The first exhibition was held in 1993, and the first exhibition was held in 1993. Until 1996, three active exhibitions were held in Cheongju and Seoul. However, they decided to take a break for a while due to the influence of their respective work directions or personal matters, but now, about 6 years later, they meet again and continue their work. In addition, in this ‘2012 Schema Museum of Art – Inhalation, Exhalation Exhibition’, a number of new female artists from Cheongju University, including Gong Ji-young, Han Young-ae, Lee Sang-ae, and Lee Kyung-hwa, have been recruited, allowing you to see richer and more diverse works. These people, who have a common denominator as graduates of Cheongju University, are led by the motto of 'desire for new artistic expression and seek various expression methods in modern art,' and the delicacy and unique sensitivity of female artists are reflected in the artist's life. Works with outstanding imagery were captured on canvas using each artist's unique method of expression.

In addition, as can be seen from the exhibition's name, it has an additional meaning in that it allows you to see in one place a variety of unique works by artists from the three countries at the center of East Asia - Korea, China, and Japan. Although the three countries of Korea, China, and Japan were born from a homogeneous culture of Eastern spirit and naturalistic ideology, they have developed and changed into a single nation-state composed of the same people. In particular, the concept of a nation after modern times can be said to be a fantasy community formed by ideology and ideals. In the 20th century, the phenomenon of 'dehumanization of art' in the art of post-industrial society has accelerated. On the one hand, this shows the limitations of Western culture, and shows that people all over the world are trying to find new alternatives for art in the 21st century in Eastern thought. You can look into it in various fields. Now the world's art world is paying attention to Oriental art. It goes without saying that the term oriental art here refers to the three countries of East Asia: Korea, China, and Japan. Now, it can be said that the contemporary art of Korea, China, and Japan is not just the culture of the Far East, but the center and future of the world's new culture.",

              explanation: "Gwangju and Cheongju writers! When you want to get to know someone, there are two ways to do it: up close or far away. Meeting you is important to get to know each of you, and meeting you is important to get to know the structure. In this way, humans meet and separate, pack and unpack things to form structures and get to know each other. That is the joy of interaction. Gwangju and Cheongju seem to have the colors of Lao Tzu and Deleuze at the same time. We are talking about modern times in two rustic neighborhoods where rural and urban, rustic and sophisticated, settlement and nomadism intersect. Just as the aspect refers to the modern era in the village of Cheongju, the later aspect also refers to the later modern era. I think it begins with a return to old-fashionedness. We settle down and live in each other's hometowns. The scent of one's hometown always becomes the identity of that person. That identity is called color. Our activities based in this area will be the same as Gwangju people operating in Gwangju. It means having color as a settler. We want to become nomads through our own colors. Perhaps this is less about actually becoming a nomad and more about being a settled person and enjoying the spiritual freedom of a nomad. I hope that the leisurely spirit of the South and the nomadology of the central region will leave a lasting impression on this exhibition by seeing and feeling the differences in color. We would like to thank Professor Kim Jong-il, all Gwangju and Cheongju artists, including Professor Kim Jong-il, who participated in this exhibition, and everyone who helped us. We would also like to thank Professor Kim Jae-gwan of the Schema Museum of Art for planning the exhibition.",

              explanation: "A glimpse into Kim Soon-cheol’s ‘object painting’ Picasso used the collage technique to change the method of painting with paint that had been used for thousands of years. Marcel Duchamp gave up on his masterpieces such as “Nude Descending the Stairs” and went one step further by directly presenting “toilet,” “bicycle wheel,” and “bottle holder” in the exhibition hall, thereby creating the so-called ‘object’ art. did. After Duchamp's 'object', there was a loud debate in the art world for a while, and there was a fuss about Duchamp being a person to kill who ruined painting or a person to save, but in the end, Duchamp's object was used by world-renowned artists such as Joseph Beuys, Jackson Pollock, and Jasper Johns. It permeates the works of great masters and creates two-dimensional object paintings. ‘Minimal art’, which became the last style of modernism, and ‘Korean monochrome painting’, which is similar at a glance but has a different concept, cannot help but deny that physicality plays a very important role in these. Suncheol Kim majored in Oriental painting in undergraduate and graduate school. An important characteristic of oriental painting is its strong conceptuality. That is why it is non-physical. However, his work cannot be called an oriental painting without the fact that it uses Korean paper or has a monochrome color tone. Rather than making a dichotomous distinction between Oriental and Western paintings, Kim Soon-cheol's paintings show the characteristic of creating two-dimensional paintings as objects using a thoroughly Korean method. Conceptual art in modern art places emphasis on non-visual elements. However, painting is an art whose primary characteristic is visuality. Kim Soon-cheol's paintings do not require useless rhetorical criticism that is neither easy to read nor well established verbally. This may be because his paintings have a very simple and elegant structure in the context of modern luxury. After the boring rainy season and hot summer, we are planning and inviting the exhibition of female artist Kim Soon-cheol, which is like a fresh breeze on the threshold of fall. We ask for your interest and appreciation.",

              explanation: "2011 Cheongju International Craft Biennale, Cheongju·Cheongwon Network Exhibition 『Hanji + Washi Paper Korea-Japan Contemporary Art Exhibition』 『Hanji + Washi Paper Korea-Japan Contemporary Art Exhibition』 held as part of the Cheongju-Cheongwon Network Exhibition of the 2011 Cheongju International Craft Biennale is held at Shema Art Museum. It is a blessing for our region and a great honor for the Schema Museum of Art. As we hold an exhibition of plastic arts using traditional paper from both Korea and Japan, we are once again reminded of the Eastern proverb, “1,000 years for paper, 500 years for silk.” Since the lifespan of paper is over a thousand years, it cannot be denied that paper itself is an entity that contains the history, culture, and art of the East at the same time. There is a record that paper was made by Cai Lun during the Later Han Dynasty in China around the 2nd century AD, and paper was already used in Korea in the 21st year of the reign of King Yeongyang of Goguryeo (610 AD), and it is also said to have been introduced to Japan by Goguryeo monk Damjing. As can be seen from Sagi's records, paper at that time is thought to have had a great influence on the knowledge industry and economy of the three Eastern countries. The development of paper led to the development of Hanji (Korean paper) as the production of paper made from mulberry trees was promoted nationwide for the mass production of Buddhist scriptures during the Goryeo Dynasty. There is a record of Song Dynasty monks praising this Goryeo paper as the best paper with excellent quality and color. In particular, Cheongju is a place where the value of Hanji (Korean paper) is valued even more because it is the place where the world's best existing metal type book, 「直指心體要節」, was printed on Goryeo paper. I think it is very meaningful that the 『Hanji + Japanese Paper Korea-Japan Contemporary Art Exhibition』 will be held at the Schema Art Museum as the 2011 Cheongju International Craft Biennale concludes. While Gutenberg's <42-Line Bible> (printed in 1460), which is considered the best metal printed book in the West, has not been released to the public due to poor paper quality, the Jikjisimcheyojeol, published 83 years earlier, has been preserved intact. Considering the fact that it is available to the public, I think we can clearly see how excellent Goryeo paper is. Hanji is a symbol of knowledge culture, but during the Joseon Dynasty, it was used in all daily crafts and became a material that created excellent Joseon crafts. Since modern times, it has been pushed aside by glossy paper due to the difficulty and efficiency of mass production, and in recent times, it has become more and more speculative, and 'Hanji' has once again been promoted by artists who use Hanji as a formative medium in modern art. I can't help but feel fortunate that I can feel the charm of '. The heart that loves Hanji. What else is this but the spirit of old, old, new, and old? Formative art using paper has been used in oriental paintings, watercolors, prints, etc., but paper itself emerged as a formative art form when Korean and Japanese paper artists in both Korea and Japan began using paper as a material for formative art. In particular, Hanji is ideal as a formative medium for modern art because it is easy to change, has elegant natural colors, and is easy to dye. Painting techniques using the rubbing technique, three-dimensional painting using the collage technique, modeling of geometric three-dimensional and organic shapes, installation work using the light nature of Korean paper, and even photography, expressed by Korean and Japanese paper artists from both Korea and Japan. , Various expression methods and forms using video techniques are being presented. Hanji and washi have surpassed the functions of paper in the past, and modern artists are continuing to rediscover and recognize materials. We would like to express our sincere gratitude and congratulate the Korean and Japanese Korean and Japanese Korean paper and washi artists who were invited to this exhibition to exhibit their works and visit Cheongju, Korea.",

              explanation: "At some point, the pictures began to become uniform. What is the current art climate in which we can find the simplest uniformity amidst so much diversity? It is inevitable that paradox and irony will be mixed repeatedly, but why is the cry for diversity sinking into even more shabby simplicity? The current global art climate is being swallowed by a huge black hole from which self-respect has faded and cannot escape. Could this be my appearance? Or is this the image of our artists living on Earth? What is it that I know myself, and what is knowledge? When nomads become persistent, people know that there is emptiness, so they have a tendency to quickly escape from the emptiness. Animals themselves are inherently good at compromise. Even people with animalistic traits cannot escape this, and they are inherently good at compromise without even being conscious of their own self-esteem. Even people with animalistic attributes cannot escape this, and are quick to compromise without even being conscious of their own self-respect. All of these results are the product of an illusory pursuit of diversity that ends up producing uniform simplicity. At this point, we become inquisitive about reaffirming our existence. Let's go back. In fact, historicity, diversity, star quality, artistry, philosophy, etc. have been repeated for generations already. It is impossible to conclude that they have been born especially better. However, the contractual contradictions that inevitably reflect the times continue, and time intervenes in the midst of them. Because I coexist with this time of continuity, I sometimes enjoy indulgence that follows the freedom of irresponsibility. For me, if I don't have the freedom to indulge myself, I have no reason to pick up a brush. Playfulness in self-indulgence creates a repeated me. The matrix that creates me is ink and ink. From now on, I refer to my parent body. Drawing is not limited to simply drawing. It is a matter of studying the limitations of the materials from which paintings will be drawn. If you do not know the specificity of the material, you will inevitably become distant from what you want to express. It is important to know the physiology of all types of paper, the type and characteristics of the brush, the pros and cons of ink, and even the material of the inkstone. The color, weight, and temperature are different depending on which ink stone is selected for the same ink. In particular, the limitations of the enormous changes in the line are indescribable. All of these are areas that cannot be approached without supersensory techniques and intuitive sensibility, such as the amount of ink and water, speed of brush strokes, strength and flexibility, balance of tones between top, bottom, left and right, and time difference between materials. Of course, there are people who sympathize with these areas, but most remain at the stage of only understanding this world. Here I encounter something called absolute solitude. The form of this work is the result of what I have attempted since 1982. The history of time, the flow, the movement process of water droplets, the flow of time, the shapes and traces of water droplets that change with time, each water drop shape and other shapes are alive as if telling a story. Rather than being a Western painting canvas (rather than developing color directly on the surface), it has the unique flavor of Oriental painting (i.e., the color that is absorbed and re-emerged - the quite deep, heavy, and mysterious coloring effect of ink), and in a way, it is a clear, vivid, and transparent drop of water. This smudged, unclear ink paint creates an effect that exudes great ambiguity and aura. Here, I work to re-edit contingency into inevitability and create an inseparable complementary relationship between coincidence and inevitability. In this way, water drops and other images combined with the background of the human body express ‘life force’ that preserves light and time.",

At first, it was just a preliminary art museum that lacked everything, but from now on, we plan to turn it into a unique art museum by thinking about how best to run it. We will develop autonomously together with like-minded people. We ask for your love and interest.",

                explanation: "The value of art can only be recognized through new changes and creative actions. Chimpanzees and humans share approximately 99.5% of their genes throughout their evolutionary history. However, like Dawkins' theory, creative genes continue to evolve only in humans. A difference of 0.5% dominates the ecosystem on Earth. And the 0.5% creative factor creates new science and new art. However, it can be said that artistic thinking has more creative value than scientific thinking. That's because we are human. I believe that the creative value of Duchamp, who created the conceptual art of a toilet as a “fountain,” has more special human value than the scientist who created a urinal for men. True art can be said to create the creative genes of the human values ​​of that era that go beyond history and science. As Picasso said, we can be considered true creators when we create art that is alive and well in our time.",

                explanation: "On August 13th, the 10th anniversary of the late teacher Kim Young-bae's memorial service was held on the 8th ridge of the Dongsam Park Cemetery, where the boring summer rainy season was over and the temperature was 30 degrees under the scorching heat wave. It was a small event attended by about 30 students, seniors and juniors, and classmates who had special interactions with Mr. Kim, along with his bereaved family. That day was a special occasion for the unveiling of a painting monument prepared by his colleagues, making it an even more meaningful occasion for remembrance. I would like to write a few words about a scene that was both ritualistic and unfamiliar during that day's ritual. At about 11:20 a.m., a bunch of white chrysanthemums, summer fruits, fish shells, and a bottle of soju, which he was very fond of, were placed on the small headstone in front of the cemetery. In addition to the late summer atmosphere of Korea, the outfit was no different from any other memorial service. According to the order of the proceedings, the bereaved family's incense was burned, followed by the ancestral rites of fellow seniors, juniors, and disciples. Then, while Teacher Park and Teacher Kim continued to recite the memorial poems, each remembering and regretting the beautiful stories about the deceased while he was alive, the author had a moment of sorrow and thought that this might be our last custom and custom. When I look at some of today's artists who do not hesitate to expose even their vulgar and vulgar character, without being considerate of their neighbors or humble towards others, but unable to maintain their own self-respect and spirit, I miss his gentle and simple demeanor even more. . In a time when there were few painters who were not influenced by money and commercialism and who only dealt with the paintings they liked and the feelings and objects they wanted to paint, he was not only a painter and a professor, but also a person of character who became a symbol of resignation for his colleagues. Perhaps in our art reality, “non-strange people” won’t come back if they wait a while longer? Even now, aren't I lucky to see him standing at an angle next to an old leather bag under a traffic light across the road crossing? Now, more than 10 years after Mr. Kim passed away, the writer of this article is probably not alone in realizing how rare ordinary people are in this world. I miss the adjectives that were always added to his name, such as a good person, a decent person, a person who is not strange, a mother-in-law, a person good at the eight provinces, etc. Possessing an exceptionally delicate sensitivity and craftsmanship, he sympathized with his view of art, which he always expressed to his friends, saying, “A good painting is a fight against pasting.” He strongly disliked unscrupulous people, and he always maintained a warm heart. I learned a lot. Even now, I still smile at the bewildered expressions on the faces of the customers at the next table who were surprised by the number of empty soju bottles we put down at the bar. The geometric landscapes of the deceased, anonymous characters, and cartoon-like fantasy gestures are refreshing. In fact, his work has some aspects in common with the pluralistic pursuit of Korean contemporary art since the 1980s. He, too, has shown a wide range of interests and aesthetic explorations, ranging from the gray-scale spatial composition of Matiel to the planar interpretation of the grid. But above all, he is a member of the first generation who sought a connection between comics and paintings since the 1990s, and is an artist who put into practice the so-called ‘cartoons within art and art within comics’, a rare interest in comics and paintings. In particular, the window frames, chairs, mechanical anonymous figures, and cartoon symbols and lines of motion that appear in his paintings have an a priori aspect that opens up the exploration of semiotic painting theory from vision to perception. He particularly enjoyed creating works that he added in his spare time in the lab, so acrylic coloring on paper seemed like his exclusive product. At first glance, his work was a process of trying to reveal the essence and schema of objects and events along with his geometric sensitivity, and the destination was always an empty and lonely ‘empty’ place. Thanks to his appearance resembling Seiji Ozawa, we were able to hear the bleak digital 'Solveig' from him early on. (He published a book called 'Filling the Blanks', and although he loved music, he was tone deaf.) Here are the works of the deceased. In addition, a memorial exhibition was prepared by collecting paintings of 14 people in his honor. Coincidentally, one of my colleagues has opened an art museum and is holding a memorial exhibition as a follow-up program to the opening exhibition. What is really nice to see is the scale and path of the human scale that aims for the universality of art in general, overcoming the judgment of specific individuals. The paintings on display each have different aims, but all of them contain a regretful feeling of remembrance in his memory. Perhaps it will be difficult to hear these kind words from colleagues for a while? Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude once again to the deceased's bereaved family, classmates, senior and junior colleagues, and students who worked hard for this exhibition. I wish good luck and good health to all artists who are cultural guardians of our time and witnesses and witnesses of contemporary aesthetics.",
